================================================================================

10:00:23 From Sarah Chen to Everyone:
    Hi everyone! We'll get started in just a minute. Still waiting for a couple people to join.

10:00:45 From Alex Kim to Everyone:
    Morning! 👋

10:00:52 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    Good morning

10:01:15 From Jennifer Park to Everyone:
    Hey all - I'm at the airport so might have background noise. Will stay muted when not talking.

10:01:33 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    No problem Jennifer, we've all been there 😅

10:02:18 From Sarah Chen to Everyone:
    OK I think we're recording now. Let's get started.

10:05:42 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    @Marcus - is the security audit the same one we discussed last week with the external firm?

10:06:01 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    @Tom yes, CyberSecure Inc. They started Monday.

10:08:15 From Jennifer Park to Everyone:
    If we push to March that's going to mess with our media buys. We've already committed budget.

10:08:44 From Alex Kim to Everyone:
    Can we split the announcement? Soft launch web, bigger push for mobile?

10:09:02 From Jennifer Park to Everyone:
    @Alex that could actually work. Let me think about it.

10:12:33 From Sarah Chen to Everyone:
    Just to confirm - phased launch: Web Feb 15, Mobile Feb 28. Is that what we're agreeing to?

10:12:55 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    Yes, contingent on security audit results this week.

10:13:18 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    Works for me. Most of my pipeline can live with web-only initially.

10:13:45 From Jennifer Park to Everyone:
    OK I can make that work. Actually might be better for building anticipation.

10:18:22 From Alex Kim to Everyone:
    Quick Q - the reorg, does that affect the CAB meeting planning at all?

10:18:45 From David Thompson to Everyone:
    @Alex no, CAB meeting proceeds as planned. Reorg is internal only.

10:19:12 From Sarah Chen to Everyone:
    Reminder: reorg discussion is CONFIDENTIAL until announcement

10:19:30 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    👍

10:19:33 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    Understood

10:24:55 From Alex Kim to Everyone:
    @Lisa is joining us for budget? I see she's not on the call.

10:25:18 From Sarah Chen to Everyone:
    Lisa couldn't make it - she sent me the numbers. I'll share.

10:28:42 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    15% engineering cut is going to be tough. We're already stretched thin on Prism.

10:29:05 From David Thompson to Everyone:
    @Marcus mainly contractor budget. We can discuss offline.

10:32:14 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    Re: CRM - this is really critical. We're losing deals to manual process overhead.

10:32:45 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    @Tom let's sync on requirements. What's your timeline for getting me specs?

10:33:02 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    I can have something by Jan 24

10:33:15 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    Works for me

10:38:50 From Jennifer Park to Everyone:
    @Marcus I'll email you the press release draft today. Need your review by Thursday if possible.

10:39:08 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    @Jennifer got it, Thursday works

10:42:33 From Alex Kim to Everyone:
    For CAB - should we invite Meridian? They've been asking about roadmap visibility.

10:43:01 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    Good idea - I have a call with their CTO next week anyway

10:43:22 From David Thompson to Everyone:
    Yes, let's invite them. Make sure they sign NDA first.

10:43:45 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    On it

10:45:12 From Sarah Chen to Everyone:
    Great meeting everyone. I'll send notes this afternoon.

10:45:30 From Jennifer Park to Everyone:
    Thanks! Sarah can we sync tomorrow on campaign timing?

10:45:45 From Sarah Chen to Everyone:
    Sure, send me an invite for afternoon. I'm free after 2.

10:45:58 From Jennifer Park to Everyone:
    Will do!

10:46:05 From Alex Kim to Everyone:
    Thanks all 👋

10:46:12 From Marcus Williams to Everyone:
    Later everyone

10:46:15 From Tom Rodriguez to Everyone:
    Bye!
