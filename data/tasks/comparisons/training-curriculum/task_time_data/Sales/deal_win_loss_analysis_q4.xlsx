Customer reference / case study    | 2     | 3%        | $45,000

KEY INSIGHTS - WINS:

1. AI FORECASTING IS OUR KILLER FEATURE
   When forecasting accuracy was the primary evaluation criteria, we won
   82% of the time. Demo the VelocityScore heavily.

2. TCO WINS ENTERPRISE DEALS
   Our "40% lower TCO than Salesforce" claim resonated in 16 deals.
   Always calculate TCO comparison in proposals.

3. FAST IMPLEMENTATION MATTERS
   "Up and running in 3-4 weeks" was decisive in 11 deals, especially
   mid-market where IT resources are constrained.

4. COMPETITIVE DISPLACEMENTS ARE LARGE
   The 5 competitive displacement deals averaged $68K - significantly
   above average. Worth the extra effort to pursue.

QUOTES FROM WON DEALS:
- "Your forecasting AI is in a different league" - Director of Sales, Tech company
- "Half the price of Salesforce with better forecasting" - VP Revenue, Manufacturing
- "We were up and running in 2 weeks" - Sales Manager, Professional Services

================================================================================
WHY WE LOST (47 deals)
================================================================================

PRIMARY LOSS REASONS

Reason                              | Count | % of Losses | Deal Value Lost
------------------------------------|-------|-------------|------------------
Already have CRM (no compelling change) | 14  | 30%       | $485,000
Selected Salesforce                 | 11    | 23%        | $612,000
Budget constraints                  | 8     | 17%        | $186,000
Selected HubSpot                    | 6     | 13%        | $198,000
Internal project / build own        | 4     | 8%         | $142,000
Selected other competitor           | 4     | 8%         | $178,000

KEY INSIGHTS - LOSSES:

1. "ALREADY HAVE A CRM" IS OUR BIGGEST OBSTACLE
   30% of losses were to inertia, not competitors. We need better messaging
   on why switching is worth it. Status quo is enemy #1.

2. SALESFORCE BRAND STILL WINS
   We lost $612K to Salesforce in Q4. Common themes: "safe choice," "already
   know it," "ecosystem." Need stronger Salesforce counter-positioning.

3. BUDGET LOSSES ARE OFTEN TIMING
   6 of 8 budget-constrained deals said they'd reconsider in 2026. Mark for
   follow-up in Q1/Q2.

4. HUBSPOT WINS ON MARKETING INTEGRATION
   All 6 HubSpot losses were companies with strong inbound motions who wanted
   marketing-sales alignment. We should qualify this out earlier.

QUOTES FROM LOST DEALS:
- "We just implemented Salesforce 2 years ago, can't justify switching" - Lost to status quo
- "Salesforce is the safe choice" - Lost to Salesforce
- "HubSpot gives us marketing and sales in one" - Lost to HubSpot

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR Q1 2026
================================================================================

1. DOUBLE DOWN ON FORECASTING MESSAGING
   Our AI forecasting is the #1 win reason. Make it central to every pitch.
   Train all reps on VelocityScore demo.

2. IMPROVE SALESFORCE COMPETITIVE RESPONSE
   We're at 52% win rate vs. Salesforce - need to get to 60%+. Schedule
   competitive training session in January.

3. QUALIFY MARKETING-LED COMPANIES EARLIER
   We lose to HubSpot when marketing integration is the priority. Add
   qualification question: "How important is marketing-sales integration?"

4. ATTACK STATUS QUO MORE AGGRESSIVELY
   30% of losses are to "do nothing." Need better ROI tools and
   pain quantification to make status quo uncomfortable.

5. TARGET LARGER DEALS
   Win rate increases with deal size. Enterprise deals worth extra effort.

6. SHORTEN SALES CYCLES
   Won deals average 47 days; lost deals average 62 days. If deal extends
   beyond 60 days without clear reason, reassess qualification.

================================================================================
ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

[ ] Schedule Salesforce competitive training - January 15
[ ] Update discovery questions to qualify marketing integration needs
[ ] Build ROI calculator for status quo cost analysis
[ ] Create case study for Professional Services vertical
[ ] Review all open deals >60 days for requalification
