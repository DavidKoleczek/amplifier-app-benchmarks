Patricia,

Oh my god, I'm so glad that's over. Never again. Let me document
this nightmare so we don't repeat it:

THE SAGA OF THE OCTOBER LEADERSHIP OFFSITE:

Attempt 1 (September 15):
- Found a slot on Oct 5, everyone confirmed
- Rachel had to fly to customer emergency the night before
- Cancelled at 10pm

Attempt 2 (September 22):
- Rescheduled to Oct 10
- David's focus time conflict - he pushed back hard
- Jennifer sided with David, cancelled to find better time

Attempt 3 (October 1):
- Oct 15 looked perfect
- CFO had board prep that he "forgot" was that day
- Found out 30 minutes before the meeting
- I cried in the bathroom

Attempt 4 (October 8):
- Oct 20, everyone SWORE they were available
- Amanda's kid got sick, she had to leave
- Continued without her but she was upset about being excluded
- Meeting was "inconclusive" - had to do it again anyway

Attempt 5 (October 15):
- FINALLY held on Oct 25
- Only took 6 weeks and approximately 847 emails
- Jennifer asked "why does this always take so long?"
- I wanted to scream

LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Get confirmations IN WRITING with specific "I will not cancel" language
2. Check EVERY calendar constraint, not just "available/busy"
3. Have a backup date ready to go
4. Always have video dial-in even for in-person (someone will be remote)
5. Never trust "probably fine" - get specifics

Anyway, hope your holidays are less stressful than my fall was!

Maria

P.S. If they ask for another offsite in January, please remind me
of this email so I can start the process early. Like really early.
