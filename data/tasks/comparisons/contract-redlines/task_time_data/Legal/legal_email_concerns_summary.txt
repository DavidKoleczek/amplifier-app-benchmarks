Subject: RE: DataFlow MSA - Legal Review Complete

Jennifer,

I've completed my review of the DataFlow MSA. Attached is our redlined version. Here's a summary of my concerns and the reasoning behind our proposed changes:

CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Address Before Signing):

1. LIABILITY CAP - Section 6.2
   Original: Both parties capped at 12 months of fees
   Our Change: Vendor capped at 3x fees; we stay at 1x
   
   Reasoning: Given the nature of their services (handling our customer data, integration with core systems), a 12-month cap exposes us to disproportionate risk. If they cause a data breach affecting our customers, our damages could easily exceed $1M+ in notification costs alone, let alone regulatory fines and litigation. The asymmetric cap reflects the asymmetric risk - they're handling OUR data.

2. INDEMNIFICATION - Section 7
   Original: Balanced indemnification including Customer Data claims
   Our Change: Expanded Vendor scope, narrowed our scope to gross negligence only
   
   Reasoning: The original language had us indemnifying them for "Customer Data" claims - that's backwards. If our data causes problems while in THEIR custody, that's their responsibility. Also added explicit coverage for data breaches and regulatory violations. These are table-stakes protections for any vendor handling PII.

3. IP OWNERSHIP - Section 4.2-4.4
   Original: Basic work product ownership language
   Our Change: Added derivative works, assignment language, ML training prohibition
   
   Reasoning: The AI/ML training prohibition is crucial. I've seen vendors use customer data to train their models, then effectively sell our insights to competitors. The derivative works language closes a common loophole where vendors claim ownership of "improvements" built on our work product.

IMPORTANT BUT NEGOTIABLE:

4. Termination Rights - Section 2.2
   Changed to asymmetric (30 days for us, 90 for them)
   This gives us flexibility if they underperform. May face pushback.

5. Insurance Limits - Section 8
   Doubled/tripled all limits. Standard practice given data sensitivity.
   They may have difficulty meeting the cyber liability increase to $10M.

6. Breach Notification - Section 9.3
   Changed from 48 hours to 24 hours. Industry standard is moving to 24.

7. Payment Terms - Section 3.2
   Extended from Net 30 to Net 45. Standard for our vendor relationships.

NICE TO HAVE (Can Concede If Needed):

8. Confidentiality survival (extended to 5 years)
9. Transition assistance clause
10. Monthly service reviews

NEGOTIATION STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION:

Start with all changes. Be prepared to:
- Concede on payment terms (back to Net 30)
- Reduce insurance limits slightly (but not below $7M cyber)
- Accept 30-day breach notification if they push hard

DO NOT concede on:
- The 3x liability cap for vendor
- IP ownership and ML training prohibition  
- Data breach indemnification

The IP and indemnification changes are dealbreakers for me. If they won't accept those, I'd recommend walking away. There are other vendors in this space.

Let me know if you want to discuss before sending to DataFlow.
