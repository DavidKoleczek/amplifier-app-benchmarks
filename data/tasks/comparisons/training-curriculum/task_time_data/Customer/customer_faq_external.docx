1. GENERAL QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: What is VelocityRM?
A: VelocityRM is an AI-powered revenue management platform designed for B2B 
sales teams. We combine traditional CRM capabilities with advanced deal 
intelligence, automated activity capture, and ML-powered forecasting to help 
sales organizations close more deals and forecast with confidence.

Q: Who is VelocityRM designed for?
A: VelocityRM is designed for B2B sales organizations with:
- 10+ sales representatives
- Complex deal cycles (30+ days)
- Need for accurate forecasting
- Desire to reduce manual data entry

We serve companies from growth-stage startups to large enterprises across 
technology, manufacturing, financial services, professional services, and 
healthcare industries.

Q: How is VelocityRM different from other CRMs?
A: Three key differentiators:

1. AI-Native Architecture: Unlike legacy CRMs that added AI as an afterthought,
   VelocityRM was built from the ground up with machine learning at its core.
   Our VelocityScore analyzes 47+ signals to predict deal outcomes.

2. Automatic Activity Capture: Most CRMs rely on reps manually logging activities.
   VelocityRM automatically captures emails, meetings, and calls, reducing admin
   time by 5+ hours per rep per week.

3. Forecasting Accuracy: Our customers consistently achieve 85%+ forecast accuracy,
   compared to the industry average of 60-70%.

Q: How long has VelocityRM been in business?
A: VelocityRM was founded in 2021 and has grown to serve 500+ customers globally.
We've raised $85M in venture funding and employ 250+ people across our San Francisco
headquarters and offices worldwide.

================================================================================
2. FEATURES & CAPABILITIES
================================================================================

Q: What is VelocityScore?
A: VelocityScore is our proprietary AI-powered deal health score. It analyzes 47
signals across four categories:
- Engagement: Email response rates, meeting frequency, stakeholder involvement
- Momentum: Stage velocity, activity trends, deal progression
- Fit: Company size, industry match, technology compatibility
- Timing: Budget cycle alignment, urgency indicators

Each deal receives a score from 0-100, with full transparency into why the score
is what it is. This isn't a black box - you can drill into each factor.

Q: How does automatic activity capture work?
A: VelocityRM connects to your email and calendar systems (Microsoft 365, Google
Workspace) via secure APIs. We automatically:
- Log emails sent to and received from contacts
- Record calendar events and meetings
- Capture call logs (with supported phone systems)
- Track email opens and link clicks (optional)

Your reps don't need to manually log anything - activities appear automatically
on deal and contact timelines.

Q: How accurate is the forecasting?
A: Our customers typically achieve 85%+ forecast accuracy within two quarters of
implementation. This compares to industry averages of 60-70% with traditional
CRM-based forecasting.

The forecasting engine uses:
- Deal-level probability based on VelocityScore
- Historical patterns from your closed deals
- Seasonal and trend adjustments
- Confidence intervals at 80% and 95% levels

Q: Can managers still override AI forecasts?
A: Absolutely. We believe in AI-augmented decision making, not AI-replaced. Managers
can override any deal forecast or the overall number. However, we track these overrides
and report on accuracy, so you can see who's making good judgment calls over time.

Q: What reports and dashboards are available?
A: VelocityRM includes 40+ standard reports covering:
- Pipeline by stage, owner, region, and segment
- Forecast accuracy and trends
- Rep performance and activity metrics
- Deal velocity and conversion rates
- Win/loss analysis

You can also create custom reports and dashboards. Professional and Enterprise plans
include advanced analytics like cohort analysis and predictive modeling.
