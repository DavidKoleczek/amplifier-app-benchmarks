Subject: RE: Benefits Updates for 2026 Onboarding Materials

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out about the onboarding deck updates. Here's a summary of the key benefits changes for 2026 that should be reflected:

MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2025:

1. Medical Plans - We switched from Aetna to United Healthcare
   - Plan tiers remain the same (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
   - Premiums went up ~8% across the board (sorry!)
   - New telehealth benefit included at no extra cost

2. 401(k) - Big improvement here!
   - Match increased from 4% to 6% (finally!)
   - Immediate vesting (was 2-year cliff before)

3. PTO Policy Change
   - Moved to "flexible PTO" model (no accrual tracking)
   - Minimum 15 days encouraged but not required
   - NOTE: This was controversial - some people loved it, others worried about taking less time

4. Parental Leave
   - Extended from 12 weeks to 16 weeks for all parents
   - No longer distinguishes "primary" vs "secondary" caregiver

5. Remote Work Stipend
   - New! $500/year for home office equipment
   - One-time $1000 setup bonus for fully remote employees

6. Mental Health
   - Expanded from 6 to 12 free therapy sessions via Lyra
   - New meditation app subscription (Headspace)

THINGS THAT STAYED THE SAME:
- Dental (MetLife) - no changes
- Vision (VSP) - no changes  
- Life insurance options
- HSA/FSA contribution limits (following IRS guidelines)
- Gym reimbursement ($75/month)

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE DECK:
Please remove any references to the "employee stock purchase program" - that was discontinued after the restructuring in Q3. I know some people were upset about it but it's not coming back.

Also - the old deck mentioned "rapid headcount growth" in several places. Given the layoffs, that messaging feels inappropriate. Maybe focus on "stability" and "sustainable growth" instead?

Let me know if you need the detailed plan documents. I can also review the benefits slides before you finalize.

Best,
Priya
