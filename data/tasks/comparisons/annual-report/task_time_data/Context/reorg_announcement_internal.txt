INTERNAL COMMUNICATION - CONFIDENTIAL
=====================================
Date: August 15, 2025
From: Executive Leadership Team
To: All Employees
Subject: Organizational Changes - Effective Immediately

Team,

Today we are announcing organizational changes that will affect approximately 12% 
of our workforce across all departments. These decisions were not made lightly 
and reflect our commitment to positioning the company for sustainable long-term 
growth.

CONTEXT
-------
The technology sector is experiencing a significant recalibration. After several 
years of rapid expansion, we must now ensure our operational structure matches 
current market realities. This is a proactive step to strengthen our foundation, 
not a response to any immediate crisis.

WHAT THIS MEANS
---------------
- Approximately 180 positions will be eliminated company-wide
- All affected employees will be notified today by their direct managers
- Impacted team members will receive:
  - Minimum 8 weeks severance (2 weeks per year of service, minimum 8)
  - 6 months extended health benefits
  - Outplacement services through CareerBridge Partners
  - Job placement assistance from our talent team
- Non-impacted employees: You are NOT affected by today's changes

FOR [DEPARTMENT NAME] SPECIFICALLY
----------------------------------
Our department will see a reduction of 8 positions:
- 4 contractor positions (technical writing) will not be renewed
- 2 positions will be consolidated into single roles
- 2 additional positions will be eliminated

I want to be clear: these changes do NOT reflect the performance of anyone on 
this team. Every person affected has contributed meaningfully to our success.
This is about organizational structure, not individual value.

WHAT STAYS THE SAME
-------------------
- Our commitment to customers remains unchanged
- All current projects will continue
- Customer support levels will be maintained
- Our mission and values remain our north star

NEXT STEPS
----------
- Today: Affected employees will have 1:1 conversations with managers
- This week: Town halls to answer questions (schedule to follow)
- Next 30 days: Transition period and knowledge transfer
- Ongoing: Support for affected colleagues' job search

SUPPORTING EACH OTHER
---------------------
This is difficult. It's okay to feel uncertain, sad, or frustrated. Please:
- Treat departing colleagues with dignity and respect
- Maintain confidentiality about who is/isn't affected
- Use our EAP resources if you need support (included in benefits)
- Reach out to me or HR with questions

I am committed to transparent communication through this transition. We will 
get through this together, and I believe we will emerge stronger.
