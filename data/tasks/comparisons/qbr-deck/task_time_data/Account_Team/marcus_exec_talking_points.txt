EXEC TALKING POINTS - ACME QBR
==============================
Prepared by: Marcus (Sales Director)
For: Leadership prep meeting Jan 10

CONTEXT
-------
This QBR is high-stakes. Acme is one of our largest accounts and their CFO 
has been asking pointed questions since the November incident. We need to 
thread the needle - be honest about challenges while reinforcing value.

CEO CONCERNS (from my 1:1 with Sarah)
-------------------------------------
1. "Are we at risk of losing Acme?"
   - Not immediate churn risk, but renewal is not guaranteed
   - Need to rebuild trust, especially with CFO David Park
   
2. "Should we offer concessions?"
   - SLA credit is still being negotiated (legal/finance)
   - DO NOT promise anything in the QBR - say "being discussed"
   - If pushed, defer to "our leadership is personally involved"

3. "What's the competitive threat?"
   - Intel suggests they've had demos with CompetitorX
   - Their pitch is probably "reliability" - we need to counter
   - Our usage metrics are actually our best defense

WHAT TO EMPHASIZE
-----------------
- Usage is UP 36% YoY despite the incident
- Feature adoption is strong (89% on reporting, up from 67%)
- Their team voluntarily expanded usage post-incident = trust signal
- We've invested in infrastructure (new monitoring, redundancy)

WHAT TO AVOID
-------------
- Do NOT bring up the November outage unless they do
- Do NOT mention specific SLA credit amounts
- Do NOT make promises about future pricing
- Do NOT speculate about incident cause (legal sensitivity)

IF THEY BRING UP THE OUTAGE
---------------------------
Acknowledge -> Apologize briefly -> Pivot to actions taken:
"We know November was disruptive. We've taken it seriously - [list improvements]. 
What matters now is the path forward, and we're committed to earning back trust."

ATTENDEE MANAGEMENT
-------------------
- Thomas Chen (VP Ops) - friendly, focus on value/features
- Maria Santos (IT Dir) - needs technical reassurance
- David Park (CFO) - skeptical, focus on ROI and stability
- [POSSIBLE] External consultant - if present, may be evaluating vendors

QBR SUCCESS CRITERIA
--------------------
1. No new concerns raised about relationship
2. CFO leaves with positive impression
3. Thomas confirms interest in expansion conversation
4. Schedule follow-up within 2 weeks
