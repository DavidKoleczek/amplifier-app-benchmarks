## Analysis

### Current State
- Our ratio of 1:$5.6M is **significantly below industry standard**
- We are operating with 40-50% fewer engineers than comparable companies
- This explains our capacity constraints and elevated turnover

### Right-Sized Team
At industry-standard ratios, our team should be:
- Conservative (1:$4.0M): **11-12 engineers**
- Typical (1:$3.5M): **13 engineers**
- Growth-focused (1:$3.0M): **15 engineers**

### Recommendation
Adding 3 engineers would bring our team to 11, achieving the conservative benchmark. This is the **minimum** needed to:
1. Reduce burnout and turnover risk
2. Deliver committed roadmap
3. Maintain competitive parity

## Competitive Risk

Without additional headcount:
- Competitors are out-innovating us (more shipping velocity)
- Enterprise deals at risk due to feature gaps
- Key talent flight to better-resourced teams
- Technical debt accumulating faster than we can address

*"We're trying to compete with 8 people against teams of 14-18. It's not sustainable."*
