Subject: Ops Team - Directory Check

Stephanie,

I reviewed the current directory for our team. A few things:

1. My team looks accurate - Nicole, Derek, and you are all listed correctly. No changes needed there.

2. I did notice that Derek Brown's title shows "Facilities Manager" but we discussed changing it to "Facilities & Safety Manager" after he got his OSHA certification last fall. Did that ever go through? If not, can we make that update now?

3. Nicole mentioned she'd like her phone extension listed - it's 1005 which I think is already there, so that should be fine.

4. For the new hires (Alex and Priya) - make sure they're added to the emergency contact list too, not just the regular directory.

5. With Sarah Mitchell leaving Engineering, we should double-check the emergency evacuation floor wardens list. James Wilson is taking over as Floor 3 warden.

Let me know if you need anything else from Ops.

Carlos
