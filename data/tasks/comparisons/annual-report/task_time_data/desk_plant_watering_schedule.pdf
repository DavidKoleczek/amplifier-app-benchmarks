CARE TIPS
=========
- Fiddle Leaf Fig: Sensitive! No direct sunlight, consistent watering
- Pothos: Basically unkillable, great for beginners
- Snake Plant: Overwatering is the only way to kill it
- Herbs: Basil is dramatic, rosemary is forgiving
- Peace Lily: Droops when thirsty (built-in reminder!)
- Orchid: Ice cube method works great

SUPPLY LOCATION
===============
- Watering can: Kitchen cabinet, left side
- Plant food: Same cabinet, top shelf
- Spray bottle: By the herbs
- Paper towels: For spills
