- Limited record types

**Service Cloud Professional vs Enterprise:**
- No omnichannel routing
- No entitlements/service contracts

- No social posting
- Basic reporting only

## Recommendation

We've provided this alternative as requested, but **we do not recommend Professional Edition** for Meridian based on your stated requirements:

1. **Workflow automation** was identified as critical - not available in Pro
2. **Territory management** needed for your sales structure - Enterprise only
3. **API needs** for integration may exceed Pro limits
4. **Custom permissions** for different teams - Enterprise only

**The savings of ~$270K/year come with significant capability gaps.**

We recommend the Enterprise bundle or discussing which specific features you could deprioritize.
