## Competitive Intelligence

### New Entrant: SupplyAI (YC W25)
- Raised $8M seed in October
- Targeting SMB segment (not our ICP)
- Worth monitoring but not immediate threat

### Kinaxis Response
- Launched "Kinaxis One" - similar positioning to us
- Pricing still enterprise-focused ($200K+ ACV)
- Our mid-market sweet spot remains defensible

### SAP/Oracle
- No significant AI-native improvements
- Still 12-18 month implementation cycles
- Our speed-to-value remains key differentiator

## Customer Advisory Board Feedback

We held our Q4 CAB meeting on December 10. Key themes:

**What they love:**
- Speed of innovation
- Customer support responsiveness
- Platform 2.0 UI improvements

**What they want:**
- More industry-specific features
- Better training/documentation
- Faster mobile app development
- Multi-language support (urgent for global companies)

**Concerns raised:**
- "Is NexusAI financially stable for the long term?"
- "What happens if you get acquired?"
- Two CAB members asked about our fundraising plans

---

## Risks

1. **Mobile timeline** - May slip 2-3 weeks based on current velocity
2. **ML dependency** - Analytics module depends on ML team capacity
3. **Internationalization** - Need dedicated resources for localization
