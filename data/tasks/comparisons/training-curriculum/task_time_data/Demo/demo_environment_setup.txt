COMMON SETUP ISSUES
===================

Issue: "Demo environment won't load"

1. Acknowledge: "Looks like we're having a technical hiccup"

2. Switch to backup: Use screenshot deck in Google Drive
   Drive > Sales > Demo > Emergency Backup Slides

3. Offer follow-up: "Let me schedule a follow-up demo so you can
   see this live. In the meantime, let me walk through the key
   screens via screenshots."
