# DataFlow Solutions - Negotiation History

## Background

DataFlow Solutions was selected through our Q3 2025 RFP process for cloud data integration services. They were one of three finalists (along with StreamConnect and DataBridge) and scored highest on technical capabilities and reference checks.

## Key Dates

- **August 2025**: Initial vendor demo and discovery
- **September 2025**: RFP submitted, responses received
- **October 2025**: Technical evaluation and POC
- **November 2025**: Final selection, began contract negotiations
- **December 2025**: First draft exchanged
- **January 2026**: Legal review complete, preparing for final negotiation

## Previous Discussions

### Pricing (Resolved)

Initial quote was $52,000/month. After negotiation:
- Agreed to $40,000/month for Year 1
- 3% annual increase cap for Years 2-3
- Volume discount if we expand to additional business units

Marcus Rivera (their VP Sales) was flexible here. They want us as a reference customer.

### Implementation Timeline (Resolved)

Originally proposed 6-month implementation. We pushed for 4 months given our Q2 deadline. They agreed with the following conditions:
- Dedicated implementation team
- Weekly status calls
- We provide resources for data mapping by Feb 15

### Data Residency (Resolved)

Initial concern: Their default is US-West data centers. We need US-East for latency.
Resolution: They agreed to US-East hosting at no additional cost.

### Support SLA (Mostly Resolved)

Standard offering: 8-hour response for critical issues
Our requirement: 4-hour response
Resolution: 4-hour response included for Severity 1 issues, 8-hour for Severity 2
Still TBD: Definition of "critical/Severity 1" - need to nail down in SOW

## Open Items for Contract Negotiation

### Liability Cap
- We haven't discussed yet
- Expect pushback on our 3x position
- Marcus mentioned their standard is 1x cap
- Fallback: Could offer 2x with unlimited for data breach

### Indemnification
- Not yet discussed in detail
- They may push back on data breach indemnification
- Reference: CloudBase deal included this, so there's precedent

### IP/ML Training Prohibition
- NEW concern raised by legal in this review
- Haven't raised with DataFlow yet
- May be sensitive - their product roadmap likely includes ML features
- Be prepared to explain our reasoning

### Insurance
- Their current coverage (per proposal):
  - CGL: $1M
  - E&O: $2M  
  - Cyber: $3M
- Our requirements are higher - they may need to increase coverage
- Ask if they can get higher limits from their carrier

## Vendor Contacts

**Marcus Rivera** - VP Sales (primary commercial contact)
- Email: marcus.rivera@dataflow.io
- Generally reasonable, wants to close the deal
- Has authority to make pricing concessions

**Sarah Chen** - Legal Counsel
- Email: sarah.chen@dataflow.io
- Haven't worked with directly yet
- Will likely be on contract negotiation calls

**Tom Williams** - Solutions Architect
- Email: tom.williams@dataflow.io
- Technical contact during POC
- Very knowledgeable, good to have on implementation calls

## Competitor Notes (for leverage)

- StreamConnect offered similar pricing but weaker on compliance features
- DataBridge has better ML capabilities but 30% more expensive
- Both offered standard 1x liability caps
- CloudBase (incumbent for another BU) has 2x cap in their contract

## Negotiation Strategy Notes

From Jennifer Walsh (VP Procurement):

> DataFlow really wants this deal - we'd be their largest customer in financial services. Use that leverage but don't be unreasonable. Marcus has been good to work with and I want to maintain the relationship.

> Priority order for negotiation:
> 1. IP protections (new, non-negotiable per Legal)
> 2. Indemnification (non-negotiable)
> 3. Liability cap (aim for 3x, accept 2x)
> 4. Insurance (flexible on exact numbers)
> 5. Everything else (nice to have)
