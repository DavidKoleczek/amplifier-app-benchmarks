# Salesforce Demo - Sales Team Perspective
## Mike Torres - VP Sales

**Date:** December 4, 2025  
**Duration:** 2 hours (felt longer)

## First Impressions

Look, I've used Salesforce at two previous companies. I know what we're getting into. It's powerful but it's also a beast. The demo confirmed what I expected - this is enterprise software for enterprise companies.

**My gut: 6/10** - Great capabilities buried under complexity

---

## What Sales Would Actually Use

### Pipeline Management
- **Good:** Comprehensive deal tracking, multiple pipelines, forecasting
- **Bad:** Takes too many clicks to update a deal. Reps will resist.
- **The board view exists** but isn't the default experience. Would need customization.

### Activity Logging
- Automatic email logging from Outlook - YES, we need this
- Call logging requires manual entry or additional tool
- Meeting scheduling via Salesforce Meetings - seemed clunky vs. Calendly

### Forecasting
- Commit categories are useful
- AI predictions (Einstein) looked interesting but team was skeptical
- Forecast hierarchy would work for our structure

### Mobile
- App is heavy - takes time to load
- Logging a note on mobile was 4+ taps
- Offline mode exists but has to be configured

## Rep Adoption Concerns

This is my biggest worry. I've seen Salesforce implementations fail because reps hate using it.

**Things that will cause resistance:**
1. Too many required fields = reps skip entering data
2. Clunky mobile = reps don't update in the field
3. "Enter everything twice" feeling if email sync isn't perfect
4. Too many tabs/options = analysis paralysis

**What we'd need to do:**
- Significant customization to simplify the interface
- Page layouts designed for our process
- Training, training, training
- Enforce usage (tie to comp?)

## Features I Actually Liked

1. **Einstein Lead Scoring** - If it works as shown, could help prioritize
2. **Path/Sales Guidance** - Step-by-step prompts for newer reps
3. **Email Templates** - Good template system with tracking
4. **Territory Management** - Built-in territory assignment would be helpful
5. **Forecasting** - Best forecasting I've seen in a CRM

---

## Features That Worried Me

1. **Report Builder** - Complex. I'll need to rely on ops for reports.
2. **Lightning Experience** - Still saw some Classic screens in demo
3. **Email Integration** - Outlook plugin has mixed reviews per sales rep chat
4. **Mobile App** - Heavy and slow compared to competitors

## Comparison to Current Spreadsheet Process

| Task | Today (Spreadsheets) | Salesforce |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| Update deal status | 2 seconds | 30+ seconds |
| View my pipeline | Open file, filter | 5 clicks minimum |
| Log a meeting | Don't bother | 1 minute+ |
| Run forecast | Manual math | Automatic (nice!) |
| Find contact history | Search email | All in one place (nice!) |

**The good:** Centralized info, forecasting, reporting  
**The bad:** More friction on daily updates

---

## What the Sales Team Needs

1. **Fast deal updates** - One-click stage changes
2. **Automatic email logging** - Zero-touch
3. **Mobile that works** - Quick notes after meetings
4. **Clean pipeline view** - Kanban, not tables
5. **Minimal required fields** - Reps will ignore if too many

Can Salesforce do this? Yes, with customization. Will it out of the box? No.

## Vendor Interaction

Marcus (AE) was professional but gave enterprise sales vibes. A lot of "at your scale" and "enterprise customers typically" language. I don't think we're their target customer honestly.

Diana (SE) was good - knew the product well. But when I asked about simpler alternatives within Salesforce, she pivoted back to full features.

**Concern:** Are we being sold more than we need?

---

## My Recommendation

Salesforce is the "nobody gets fired for buying IBM" choice. It will work. It will do everything we need and more. But:

- It's expensive
- It's complex
- My team will complain (initially)
- We'll need to invest in customization and training

If we're building for 500+ users and need bulletproof enterprise features, yes. If we're optimizing for 150 users who need to adopt quickly, I'd look hard at simpler options.

**I could live with Salesforce.** But I'm not excited about it.

## Questions for Next Steps

1. Can we see a simplified UI demo focused on rep workflow?
2. What does a "light touch" implementation look like?
3. Reference call with a sales leader at similar company size?
4. What's adoption rate like at mid-market customers?
