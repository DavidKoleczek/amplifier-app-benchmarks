# Objection Handling Bible
**Compiled by Janet Morrison, Senior AE**  
**Last Updated: January 2026**

These are REAL objections from REAL deals. I've included what works and what doesn't based on 4 years of selling VelocityRM. New reps: memorize the top 10 at minimum.

---

## PRICING OBJECTIONS

### "It's too expensive"

**What they're really saying:** They don't see the value yet, or they're testing your discount flexibility.

**What works:**
> "I hear you - every dollar matters. Let me ask: what would it be worth to have 30% more accurate forecasts? Our customers typically see [X] in recovered revenue from deals that would have slipped. Even a 10% improvement on a $1M pipeline is $100K. At $85/user, you'd break even with one saved deal."

**What doesn't work:**
- Immediately offering a discount (signals weakness)
- Getting defensive about pricing
- Comparing to cheaper competitors feature-by-feature

**Advanced move:** Ask "expensive compared to what?" to understand their benchmark.

---

### "We can't afford it this quarter"

**What works:**
> "Totally understand budget timing. Let's do this - let's complete the evaluation now so you're ready when budget opens up. When does your next fiscal year start? We can structure a deal that starts then, but lock in current pricing."

**What doesn't work:**
- Pushing for immediate close when there's genuinely no budget
- Suggesting they're being untruthful

**Note:** Sometimes "no budget" means "not a priority." Dig deeper: "If budget weren't a constraint, would this be something you'd move forward with?"

---

### "We found something cheaper"

**What works:**
> "That's great you're being thorough! Curiosity - what's the price difference we're talking about? [Let them answer] Got it. Beyond price, what's most important to you in this decision? I want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples on the things that matter."

Then pivot to value/capabilities where we win. Usually cheaper = less capable.

**What doesn't work:**
- Badmouthing the cheaper alternative
- Racing to match price without understanding the gap

---

## COMPETITIVE OBJECTIONS

### "We're going with Salesforce"

**What works:**
> "Salesforce is a great company - there's a reason they're the market leader. Can I ask what specifically about Salesforce stood out? [Listen carefully] Those are valid points. For comparison, our customers who evaluated both often cite [specific advantages: AI-native forecasting, faster implementation, lower TCO]. Would it be worth a 30-minute call to see how we compare on [their specific criteria]?"

**What doesn't work:**
- Attacking Salesforce directly (they're respected, you'll seem desperate)
- Pretending we do everything they do

**Honest disadvantage:** Salesforce has broader ecosystem and name recognition. We win on innovation, simplicity, and value.

---

### "We already have HubSpot / Pipedrive / [other CRM]"

**What works:**
> "Perfect - how's that working for you? [If problems emerge] Yeah, we hear that a lot. [Tool] is great for [what it's good at], but as teams scale, they often hit walls with [forecasting/automation/analytics]. VelocityRM doesn't have to replace what you have - some customers layer us on top for the intelligence layer. Would you be open to seeing how that could work?"

**What doesn't work:**
- Insisting they rip and replace if they're happy
- Underestimating switching costs

---

### "Why should we switch from what we have?"

**What works:**
> "Honestly, if what you have is working great, you shouldn't switch. Switching has costs. But let me ask - on a scale of 1-10, how satisfied is your sales team with the current tools? [If <8] What's missing that would make it a 10?"

Then listen and position against those gaps.

---

## TIMING OBJECTIONS

### "We need to think about it"

**What they're really saying:** You haven't created enough urgency, or they have unspoken concerns.

**What works:**
> "Absolutely, this is an important decision. To help me help you think through it - what specifically are you weighing? Is it fit, timing, budget, or something else I can address?"

Then handle whatever they reveal.

**What doesn't work:**
- Accepting "we need to think about it" at face value
- Being pushy or desperate

---

### "Maybe next quarter / next year"

**What works:**
> "Got it. Help me understand the timing - is there something happening next quarter that makes it a better time, or is this more about competing priorities right now?"

If it's real timing (budget cycles, other projects), respect it and plan accordingly.
If it's a brush-off, try: "In my experience, 'next quarter' sometimes means 'not a priority.' I'd rather know now if this isn't the right fit so I don't waste your time."

---

### "We're in the middle of [big project / reorg / etc.]"

**What works:**
> "Makes sense - you've got a lot on your plate. What's the timeline on [project]? Would it make sense to reconnect in [X weeks] when things settle down? I'll put a reminder on my calendar and follow up then."

**What doesn't work:**
- Ignoring their reality and pushing anyway
- Disappearing completely (stay loosely engaged)

---

## TRUST/RISK OBJECTIONS

### "You're too small / we've never heard of you"

**What works:**
> "Fair point - we're not a household name yet. What I can tell you is we have 500+ customers, including [relevant logos in their industry]. We're backed by [investors] and growing 100% year over year. Would it help to connect you with a customer in your industry who can share their experience?"

**What doesn't work:**
- Being defensive about company size
- Overpromising to compensate

---

### "What if you go out of business?"

**What works:**
> "Valid concern - I'd ask the same thing. Here's our situation: we've raised $85M from top-tier investors, we're growing rapidly, and we have strong unit economics. We're not going anywhere. That said, your data is always yours - you can export it anytime. We also offer SLAs on data portability for Enterprise customers."

---

### "We've been burned by vendors before"

**What works:**
> "I hear you - bad vendor experiences are frustrating. Can you share what happened? I want to make sure we avoid the same pitfalls."

Then directly address their specific concern with how we're different.

---

## STAKEHOLDER OBJECTIONS

### "I need to get buy-in from [someone else]"

**What works:**
> "Of course - who else is involved in this decision? [Get names] Would it make sense to include them in our next call? I want to make sure everyone's questions get answered."

**What doesn't work:**
- Trying to close with someone who can't actually decide
- Not offering to help them sell internally

**Pro tip:** Offer to create an internal summary doc they can share with stakeholders.

---

### "IT / Security / Legal has concerns"

**What works:**
> "Totally normal - we go through this with every enterprise customer. What specifically are they concerned about? We have [SOC 2 certification, GDPR compliance, standard DPA, etc.]. I can connect you with our security team or send over our compliance documentation."

Have these ready:
- SOC 2 Type II report
- Security whitepaper
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
- Penetration test summary

---

## THE "NO" OBJECTIONS

### "We're not interested"

**What works:**
> "I appreciate you being direct. Before I let you go - is it that you're not interested in improving [forecasting/pipeline visibility/etc.], or just not interested in what you've heard about us so far?"

Sometimes they'll reveal the real objection. If truly not interested, thank them and move on.

---

### "Take us off your list"

**What works:**
> "Will do. Just so I know for my own learning - was there something about our outreach that wasn't relevant, or is this not a priority for your team?"

Then actually take them off the list. Nothing burns bridges faster than ignoring this request.

## JANET'S GOLDEN RULES FOR OBJECTION HANDLING

1. **Never argue.** You can't win an argument with a customer.

2. **Acknowledge first.** "I understand..." or "That's a fair point..." before responding.

3. **Ask before answering.** "Can you tell me more about that?" often reveals the real objection.

4. **Use social proof.** "Other customers felt the same way until they saw..."

5. **Know when to walk away.** Not every deal is meant to close. Qualify hard and focus on winnable deals.

6. **Practice out loud.** Reading these scripts isn't enough. Role-play with your manager weekly.
