QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:

Q: Why Pipedrive over other options?

Tom: We're a small shop and needed something our consultants would 
actually use between client meetings. We tried Salesforce years ago - 
disaster. Nobody used it. Too complicated for a small team.

Pipedrive just... works. You open it, see your pipeline, drag deals 
around. Five minutes of training and people get it. That simplicity 
is worth a lot when you're running lean.


Q: How has it performed over 3 years?

Tom: Rock solid. We've never had an outage that I can remember. The 
pipeline view is still the best I've seen - it's visual in a way that 
makes sense to salespeople. Our close rate actually went up because 
people could see deals going stale.

We added LeadBooster last year for the chatbot and prospector features. 
Decent ROI on that.


Q: What CAN'T Pipedrive do?

Tom: [laughs] How much time do you have?

Look, Pipedrive does one thing really well: sales pipeline. If you 
want anything else, you need other tools.

- Marketing? We use Mailchimp separately. They don't talk well.
- Support ticketing? We use Zendesk. Separate system.
- Complex reporting? I export to Excel. Pipedrive's reporting is basic.
- Invoicing/Quoting? We use PandaDoc. Another subscription.

So yeah, we have like 5 different tools. It works, but it's not ideal.


Q: Any security or compliance issues?

Tom: For a 45-person consulting firm, not really. Our IT guy (part-time) 
did a basic review and said it was fine. We're not handling healthcare 
data or government contracts, so SOC 2 wasn't a dealbreaker.

I know they're working on SOC 2 now. For bigger companies or regulated 
industries, that might matter more.


Q: How does pricing compare to alternatives?

Tom: Way cheaper than Salesforce. Like, not even close. We pay around 
$20K/year for 32 users. Salesforce quoted us over $100K for comparable 
features.

But if I add up Pipedrive + Mailchimp + Zendesk + PandaDoc + other 
tools, we're probably at $45K. Still cheaper than Salesforce, but 
the gap isn't as big as it looks.


Q: Would you recommend Pipedrive to a company Meridian's size (150 users)?

Tom: [pause] Honestly? I'd think hard about it.

Pipedrive is perfect for us at 30-50 users. Everyone can use it, 
minimal admin, it just works.

At 150 users, you're getting into territory where you might want:
- More sophisticated permissions
- Better reporting
- Native marketing automation
- Real security certifications

If your sales team is the primary focus and you can live with the 
limitations, Pipedrive is great. If you need an all-in-one platform, 
I'd look at HubSpot. If you need enterprise-grade everything, 
Salesforce.

Pipedrive's sweet spot is probably 10-75 users.


Q: Any regrets?

Tom: I wish Pipedrive had better marketing integration. The Campaigns 
add-on is weak. We're essentially running two separate systems.

Also, their support is responsive but not amazing. For technical 
issues, you might wait a few days.


Q: What would make you leave Pipedrive?

Tom: If we grew to 100+ people, I'd probably move to HubSpot. The 
multiple tools thing gets annoying at scale. But for now, Pipedrive 
does what we need.

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM JENNIFER:

Q: How do your reps like the mobile app?

Tom: They love it. It's fast, simple, works offline. My consultants 
update deals from airport lounges all the time. This was actually a 
big selling point vs. Salesforce - their mobile was terrible.


Q: Any issues with data quality or duplicate contacts?

Tom: Pipedrive has duplicate detection that works okay. Not perfect - 
we still get some duplicates - but it catches most of them. We do a 
quarterly cleanup.


Q: What about integrations with other tools?

Tom: Hit or miss. Google Workspace integration is great. Slack is fine. 
Some other integrations through Zapier work but feel duct-taped together.

If tight integrations matter, look at how Pipedrive connects to your 
specific tools before committing.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:

Tom was helpful and candid about Pipedrive's limitations. Key takeaways:
- Excellent for small sales teams (10-75 users)
- Best-in-class pipeline visualization and mobile app
- Very easy to adopt - minimal training needed
- Limited beyond core sales functionality
- Multiple tools needed = hidden complexity/cost
- May outgrow it at 100+ users
- Security certifications still in progress

For Meridian at 150 users, Pipedrive might be at the edge of its 
sweet spot. Worth considering for pure sales, but gaps in marketing, 
service, and enterprise features are real.
