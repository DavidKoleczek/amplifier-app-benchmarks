| Pipedrive Ent | $534,960 | $3,566 | $99 |

## Value Analysis

### Salesforce
**Cost:** Highest  
**Value:** Most comprehensive feature set, best security, lowest risk  
**ROI Question:** Do we need this level of capability?

### HubSpot
**Cost:** Lowest  
**Value:** Excellent marketing+sales integration, good features, fast implementation  
**ROI Question:** Can it scale with us? Security gaps?

### Pipedrive
**Cost:** Middle  
**Value:** Best sales UX, fastest adoption, but gaps in marketing/service  
**ROI Question:** Is it enterprise-ready? Total cost with add-ons?

---

## Recommendation (Finance Perspective)

**If security certifications are non-negotiable:** Salesforce (expensive but necessary)

**If we can accept HubSpot's security level:** HubSpot (best value by far)

**If pure sales efficiency is priority:** Pipedrive Professional (but factor in add-on tools)

---

## Caveats

1. Hidden costs are estimates - need validation
2. Assumes no user growth (150 users static)
3. Doesn't account for productivity gains/losses
4. Salesforce overruns are common - could be worse
5. HubSpot pricing could increase at renewal (startup pattern)
6. Pipedrive SOC 2 timeline is unconfirmed

---

**THIS IS A DRAFT. Need input from:**
- IT on hidden technical costs
- Sales on productivity impact
- Legal on compliance requirements
