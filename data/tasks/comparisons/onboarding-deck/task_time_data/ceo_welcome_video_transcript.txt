Hey there! I'm Marcus Webb, founder and CEO of HorizonWorks. On behalf of 
the entire leadership team and everyone here, I want to personally welcome 
you to the company.

The fact that you're watching this means you made it through our interview 
process - which, by the way, is pretty rigorous. So first off, 
congratulations. You earned your spot here, and we're thrilled to have you.

I want to take a few minutes to share why I started this company and what 
I think makes this place special.

[ABOUT HORIZONWORKS]

I founded HorizonWorks back in 2018 with a simple observation: enterprise 
software is broken. The tools that big companies use to run their 
businesses are complicated, slow, and - let's be honest - kind of ugly. 
Meanwhile, consumer apps are delightful. Why can't business software be 
like that?

That's the problem we're solving. We're building the next generation of 
enterprise tools that are powerful enough for the Fortune 500 but simple 
enough that anyone can use them without a week of training.

And we're not just dreaming here. We have over 2,000 customers now, 
including some of the biggest names in tech, finance, and healthcare. 
We're one of the fastest-growing enterprise software companies in the 
industry. And honestly? We're just getting started.

[OUR FIVE-YEAR VISION]

Let me share where I see us heading. In five years, I want HorizonWorks to 
be THE name in enterprise productivity. When someone says "we need to 
streamline our operations," I want HorizonWorks to be the first name that 
comes to mind.

To get there, we're investing heavily in three areas:

First, AI. We're building AI capabilities into every product. Not gimmicky 
AI, but genuinely useful intelligence that makes our software smarter over 
time.

Second, global expansion. We're already in North America and Europe. 
Next up is Asia-Pacific, where we see massive opportunity.

Third, and most importantly, our people. The reason you're here is because 
we're scaling rapidly. We're adding hundreds of talented people like you 
to tackle bigger challenges and serve more customers.

[OUR CULTURE]

Culture is everything to me. I've seen companies with great products fail 
because their culture was toxic. I've also seen companies with mediocre 
products succeed because they built great teams.

At HorizonWorks, we believe in a few core things:

We move fast. Not recklessly, but with urgency. Our customers are counting 
on us, and we don't have time to waste.

We're honest with each other. If something's not working, we say it 
directly. No politics, no backstabbing. Just straight talk and respect.

We take ownership. When you join HorizonWorks, you're not just filling a 
role - you're taking ownership of outcomes. That means you have the 
freedom to make decisions, and the responsibility for the results.

And we take care of each other. This is a marathon, not a sprint. We want 
you to do your best work here for years, not burn out in months.

[YOUR ROLE]

Here's what I want you to know: you matter. Whatever role you're in - 
engineering, sales, marketing, operations, whatever - you're part of 
something bigger. The work you do contributes directly to our mission.

Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to challenge assumptions. 
Some of our best ideas have come from people in their first few months who 
saw something with fresh eyes.

Your manager is there to support you. Your teammates are there to support 
you. And honestly, my door is always open too. I mean that. If you have an 
idea or a concern, you can email me directly. I may not respond instantly, 
but I read every message.

[CLOSING]

I started this company because I believed we could build something 
remarkable. Six years later, I'm more convinced than ever. Not because of 
our funding or our revenue or our customer logos - though those are nice - 
but because of the people in this company. People like you.

Welcome to HorizonWorks. I'm so glad you're here.

Let's build something incredible together.
