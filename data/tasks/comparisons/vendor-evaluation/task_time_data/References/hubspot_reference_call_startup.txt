QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:

Q: What made you choose HubSpot?

Marcus: We were actually on Salesforce Essentials before - their small 
business tier. It was painful. Too complex for our size, mobile was 
terrible, and our marketing team was on a completely separate system 
(Mailchimp). When we started scaling and needed to upgrade, we evaluated 
both Salesforce Enterprise and HubSpot.

HubSpot won for three reasons:
1. Marketing + Sales in one system - game changer
2. Way easier to use - reps actually log stuff
3. Half the cost for what we needed


Q: How was implementation?

Marcus: Shockingly smooth. We went live in 6 weeks. The HubSpot team was 
good - not as polished as Salesforce's enterprise consultants, but they 
knew the product cold. Data migration was straightforward because we 
didn't have that much historical data.

The biggest work was on our side - cleaning up our processes and deciding 
what we actually needed vs. what we thought we needed.


Q: User adoption - how did it go?

Marcus: This is where HubSpot really shines. Our sales team was using it 
properly within 2 weeks. Like, actually logging activities, updating 
deals, using sequences. I've never seen that with any other CRM.

The mobile app is fast. Reps actually pull it out after meetings. That 
never happened with Salesforce.

Marketing adoption was instant because the tools are genuinely good. 
Our CMO called it "the best marketing software she's used."


Q: Any limitations or pain points?

Marcus: Being honest, a few:

1. Custom objects are still maturing. We hit some walls when trying to 
   build complex data relationships. Had to work around it.

2. Reporting depth - for really complex multi-touch attribution, we 
   ended up connecting to Looker. HubSpot's native reporting is good 
   but not great.

3. Enterprise features require Enterprise pricing. Some things we 
   thought would be in Professional required upgrade.

4. If you have really complex sales processes (multiple currencies, 
   complex territories, CPQ), HubSpot might feel limiting.


Q: Security and compliance - any concerns?

Marcus: For us, no. We're a SaaS company, not healthcare or government. 
SOC 2 was enough for our customers. If we had HIPAA or FedRAMP 
requirements, HubSpot wouldn't work - they're clear about that.

IT did a security review and found it acceptable for business data. 
We have a policy not to put anything sensitive (SSNs, health data) 
in HubSpot, but that's true for any CRM really.


Q: Cost - did it come in as expected?

Marcus: Yes, actually. HubSpot's pricing is pretty transparent. We pay 
about $40K/year total for everything. That includes marketing for 
50K contacts, sales for 85 users, service for 10 agents.

Compare that to Salesforce where we'd be looking at probably $200K+ 
for equivalent functionality. Even with some add-ons and integrations, 
we're way ahead.


Q: Would you choose HubSpot again?

Marcus: 100%. It's not perfect, but for a company our size (50-500 
employees), I think it's the sweet spot. Enterprise enough to grow with 
you, simple enough that people actually use it.

My only caveat: if you're going to 1000+ users or have hardcore 
compliance requirements, start thinking about Salesforce. HubSpot's 
sweet spot is mid-market.


Q: Advice for Meridian?

Marcus: 
1. Take the marketing piece seriously. The real value is the unified 
   platform. If you just use Sales Hub, you're missing half the benefit.

2. Don't over-customize day one. HubSpot's defaults are good. Start 
   there, then customize as you learn what you actually need.

3. Your sales team will thank you. Seriously. The adoption difference 
   vs. Salesforce is dramatic.

4. Budget for Operations Hub if you need complex integrations. The 
   data sync and workflow features are powerful.


Q: Anything you wish you'd known before?

Marcus: I wish I'd known how much time we wasted on Salesforce trying 
to make it work for a team our size. We should have gone HubSpot 
earlier. Live and learn.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:

Marcus was enthusiastic - clearly a HubSpot fan. Takeaways:
- Outstanding for mid-market companies (50-500 employees)
- User adoption is genuinely better (reps actually use it)
- Marketing + Sales integration is the killer feature
- Some enterprise limitations (complex customization, reporting)
- Security acceptable for business data, not for PHI
- Significant cost savings vs. enterprise CRM

Good fit for Meridian's size. Security gap for healthcare clients 
is the main concern.
