This is critical context for the campaign recap - recommend presenting multiple views.

* First Click total differs due to cross-device tracking limitations

MODEL COMPARISON - REVENUE BY CHANNEL:
--------------------------------------

Channel          | Last Click  | First Click | Linear    | Time Decay | Data-Driven
-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------------

LinkedIn Paid    | $28,670     | $41,230     | $35,620   | $31,180    | $37,890
Email            | $64,230     | $23,450     | $42,120   | $53,340    | $46,780

Referral         | $12,120     | $23,450     | $18,370   | $14,560    | $17,200

KEY INSIGHTS:
-------------
1. Google Paid looks best under Last Click (our default), but Facebook looks 
   much stronger under First Click - FB is good at awareness, Google at closing

2. Email appears to be primarily a "closer" - strong Last Click, weak First Click
   This makes sense - people research, then act when they get the reminder email

3. LinkedIn punches above its weight in First Click - good for B2B awareness
   Consider this when evaluating LinkedIn's seemingly low direct conversion numbers

4. Data-Driven model (Google's ML-based) tends to redistribute credit more evenly
   This is probably the most "accurate" but hardest to explain to stakeholders

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESENTATION:
---------------------------------
1. Show Last Click as primary (it's what we've always shown, maintains consistency)
2. Include footnote about attribution model limitations
3. Consider adding "assisted conversions" view to show full-funnel contribution
4. For Facebook specifically, show First Click alongside Last Click

CAVEATS:
--------
- April 11-24 data gap affects all models
- Cross-device tracking has ~15% gap (users who start on mobile, convert on desktop)
- Data-Driven model requires 300+ conversions per channel for reliability
  * Twitter and Referral fall below this threshold
