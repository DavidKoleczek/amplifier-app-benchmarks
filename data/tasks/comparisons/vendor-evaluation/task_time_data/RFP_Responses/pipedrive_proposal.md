## Technical Details

### Platform

| Feature | Details |

| Uptime | 99.9% SLA |
| Data Hosting | US (AWS) or EU (AWS Frankfurt) |
| API | RESTful, 200 calls/sec limit |

### Security

**Certifications:**

**Security Measures:**

**Honest Assessment:** Our security certifications are evolving. We currently do not have SOC 2, ISO 27001, or HIPAA certifications. For highly regulated industries, this may be a consideration.

- Native CPQ/quoting

## Implementation

### Pipedrive Advantage: Start Selling Fast

## Honest Comparison: Where Pipedrive Wins and Where It Doesn't

### Where We Excel

| Strength | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Ease of use | Fastest adoption, lowest training cost |
| Price/value | 60-80% less than enterprise CRMs |
| Sales focus | Built for sellers, not administrators |
| Speed | 2-3 weeks to value, not 4-6 months |
| Pipeline visualization | Best-in-class visual interface |

### Where Others May Win

| Consideration | Our Position |
|---------------|--------------|
| Enterprise complexity | We're simpler - that's intentional, but may not suit complex enterprises |
| Marketing automation | Our Campaigns tool is basic vs. Pardot/HubSpot |
| Service/ticketing | Not our focus - we integrate with dedicated tools |
| Security certifications | SOC 2 in progress; no HIPAA/FedRAMP |
| Customization depth | Less customizable than Salesforce |
| Advanced reporting | Solid but not as deep as Tableau/Einstein |
