- What's their approval limit?
- Have we engaged them directly?
- Target: Direct conversation with budget holder

- What's must-have vs. nice-to-have?
- Are criteria documented?
- Target: Understand and influence criteria in our favor

3. DISCOVERY BEST PRACTICES
===========================

The Rule of Three Whys:
- Surface problem → "Why is that a problem?"
- Business impact → "Why does that matter to the business?"
- Personal impact → "Why does that matter to you?"

Key Discovery Questions:

CURRENT STATE
- "Walk me through how you manage your sales pipeline today."
- "What tools are you currently using? How long have you used them?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with your current solution?"

PAIN IDENTIFICATION
- "What's the biggest challenge you face with forecasting accuracy?"
- "How much time does your team spend on manual data entry?"
- "When was the last time a deal slipped unexpectedly? What happened?"

IMPACT QUANTIFICATION
- "What's the revenue impact of inaccurate forecasts?"
- "How many deals are lost due to lack of visibility?"
- "What would 10% better forecast accuracy mean in dollar terms?"

DECISION PROCESS
- "Besides yourself, who else is involved in this evaluation?"
- "What would need to be true for you to move forward?"
- "What's your ideal timeline for implementation?"

4. DEMO STRATEGY
================

Demo Principles:
1. NEVER demo without discovery first
2. Customize every demo to their specific pain points
3. Show 3 features max - depth over breadth
4. End every demo with clear next steps

Standard Demo Flow (45 minutes):
- Recap pain points (5 min)
- Tailored feature demonstration (25 min)
- Customer questions (10 min)
- Next steps (5 min)

Demo Environments:
- Production demo: demo.velocityrm.io (for most demos)
- Industry-specific: demo-manufacturing.velocityrm.io, demo-finserv.velocityrm.io
- Sandbox: Request via #demo-support in Slack

See Demo/ folder for detailed scripts and gotchas.

5. PROPOSAL & NEGOTIATION
=========================

Proposal Best Practices:
- Always present proposals live (never just email)
- Include 3 options when possible (good/better/best)
- Lead with business value, not features
- Include clear timeline and next steps

Negotiation Guidelines:
- Never discount without getting something in return
- Common trade items: Contract length, payment terms, case study rights
- Maximum discounts: See pricing documentation
- Always involve manager for discounts >15%

---

6. CLOSING TECHNIQUES
=====================

Trial Close Questions:
- "Based on what you've seen, does this solve your [specific pain]?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you this is the right solution?"
- "What would prevent us from moving forward this quarter?"

Assumptive Close:
- "Let's look at the implementation timeline. When would you want to go live?"
- "I'll send over the contract. Who should I cc from your procurement team?"

Urgency Creation (Ethical):
- End of quarter/year discounts (real, time-limited)
- Implementation capacity (actually constrained)
- Price increase announcements (when true)

---

7. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
==========================

See competitive_battlecards.pdf for detailed competitor analysis.

Quick Competitive Soundbites:

vs. Salesforce:
"Salesforce is great for many things, but it was built 20 years ago. VelocityRM was built AI-first for modern revenue teams. Our customers see 30% better forecast accuracy and save 5+ hours per rep per week on admin."

vs. HubSpot:
"HubSpot is excellent for inbound marketing. For serious B2B sales teams with complex deals, you'll find VelocityRM's deal intelligence and forecasting capabilities are in a different league."

vs. Pipedrive:
"Pipedrive is designed for small teams. As you scale, you'll outgrow it quickly. VelocityRM grows with you from 10 reps to 10,000."

vs. "We have a CRM already":
"Our best customers already have a CRM. VelocityRM either replaces it entirely or layers on top to provide the intelligence and automation that basic CRMs lack."

8. OBJECTION HANDLING
=====================

See common_objections_janet.md for comprehensive objection responses.

Top 5 Objections Quick Reference:

1. "It's too expensive"
→ "I understand budget is important. Let's talk about ROI. Our average customer sees [X] return in year one. What would even half of that mean for your business?"

2. "We need to think about it"
→ "Of course. To help me help you, what specifically do you need to think through? Is it fit, timing, or something else?"

3. "We're locked into our current contract"
→ "When does that contract end? Let's plan the evaluation to align with your renewal. We can also discuss contract buyout options for the right situations."

4. "We don't have time to implement"
→ "That's exactly why we offer implementation packages. Most customers are up and running in 3-4 weeks with minimal IT involvement. What does your timeline look like?"

5. "We're looking at [competitor] too"
→ "Great, you should evaluate all options. What criteria are most important to your decision? I want to make sure we're addressing what matters most to you."
