Success Stories from Our Customers

================================================================================
CASE STUDY #1: TECHSTART INC.
Industry: Technology / SaaS
Company Size: 150 employees, 25 sales reps
================================================================================

THE CHALLENGE
-------------
TechStart is a fast-growing B2B SaaS company selling to mid-market businesses.
Before VelocityRM, they struggled with:

- Forecast accuracy of only 55% - constantly missing or sandbagging numbers
- Sales reps spending 10+ hours per week on manual CRM updates
- No visibility into which deals were actually healthy vs. at risk
- Lost deals because follow-ups fell through the cracks

"We were flying blind," says Jennifer Martinez, VP of Sales. "Every board meeting,
I'd present a forecast and hold my breath. We missed our number 4 quarters in a row."

THE SOLUTION
------------
TechStart implemented VelocityRM Professional in Q2 2025. Key features adopted:

1. Automatic Activity Capture
   - Connected Microsoft 365 for email and calendar sync
   - Eliminated manual activity logging
   - Reps now spend time selling, not typing

2. VelocityScore Deal Intelligence
   - Every deal scored 0-100 based on 47 signals
   - At-risk deals flagged automatically
   - Managers intervene early instead of finding out at month-end

3. AI-Powered Forecasting
   - Replaced gut-feel forecasting with data-driven predictions
   - Confidence intervals help with scenario planning
   - Historical accuracy tracking drives accountability

THE RESULTS
-----------
After 6 months with VelocityRM:

✓ Forecast accuracy improved from 55% to 87%
✓ Reps save 8+ hours per week on admin tasks
✓ Pipeline velocity increased 23%
✓ Win rate improved from 22% to 31%
✓ $1.2M in additional revenue attributed to better deal management

"VelocityRM gave us X-ray vision into our pipeline," says Martinez. "For the first
time, I can tell the board exactly what we're going to close, and be right."

CASE STUDY #2: PRECISION MANUFACTURING CO.
Industry: Manufacturing
Company Size: 800 employees, 40 sales reps
================================================================================

THE CHALLENGE
-------------
Precision Manufacturing sells complex industrial equipment with deal cycles
averaging 6-9 months and deal sizes from $100K to $2M. Their challenges:

- Long sales cycles made forecasting extremely difficult
- Multiple stakeholders on each deal created confusion
- Legacy CRM (Salesforce) was underutilized and had poor data quality
- Sales managers couldn't identify stalled deals until too late

"Our deals have 8-12 people involved on the customer side," explains Robert Chen,
Director of Sales Operations. "Tracking all those relationships in our old CRM
was impossible. Deals would go dark for months and we wouldn't know why."

THE SOLUTION
------------
Precision implemented VelocityRM Enterprise alongside their existing Salesforce
instance, using bi-directional sync to maintain both systems. Key features:

1. Stakeholder Mapping
   - Track all contacts involved in each deal
   - Relationship strength scoring per stakeholder
   - Identify missing personas (no champion? no economic buyer?)

2. Deal Health Monitoring
   - VelocityScore adapted for long sales cycles
   - Early warning when deals go quiet
   - Manager alerts when key stakeholders disengage

3. Custom Forecasting Model
   - ML model trained on their specific deal patterns
   - Account for seasonality in manufacturing buying
   - Multi-quarter pipeline visibility

THE RESULTS
-----------
After 12 months with VelocityRM:

✓ Forecast accuracy improved from 62% to 88%
✓ Average sales cycle reduced by 18 days
✓ Identified and saved 12 "zombie" deals worth $4.3M
✓ Manager coaching time increased 40% (less time on admin)
✓ CRM data quality score improved from 34% to 91%

"VelocityRM doesn't replace Salesforce for us - it makes Salesforce actually useful,"
says Chen. "The deal intelligence layer gives us visibility we never had before."
