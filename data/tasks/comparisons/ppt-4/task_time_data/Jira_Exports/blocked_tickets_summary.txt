PROJECT PHOENIX - BLOCKED TICKETS ANALYSIS
Generated: 2025-12-20
Report Period: Full Project (March 2025 - December 2025)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total tickets blocked at some point: 127 of 847 (15%)
Average block duration: 8.3 days
Longest block: 34 days (PHX-456: Salesforce API rate limiting resolution)

This report identifies systematic blocking patterns, not individual performance issues.

================================================================================
BLOCKING CATEGORIES
================================================================================

1. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY BLOCKS (42 tickets, 33%)
   -------------------------------------------
   - Salesforce API documentation unclear: 18 tickets blocked
   - HubSpot sandbox environment issues: 12 tickets blocked
   - Client environment access delays: 8 tickets blocked
   - Third-party library bugs: 4 tickets blocked

   Root Cause: Integration work started before all API access was confirmed.
   Lesson: Validate all external dependencies before sprint commitment.

2. INTERNAL ARCHITECTURE BLOCKS (31 tickets, 24%)
   -----------------------------------------------
   - Multi-tenant refactor cascade: 14 tickets blocked
   - Database schema changes: 9 tickets blocked
   - API contract changes: 8 tickets blocked

   Root Cause: Major architecture changes (multi-tenancy) mid-project created
   ripple effects across all dependent work.
   Lesson: Scope changes requiring architecture rework need full impact analysis.

3. SCOPE CHANGE BLOCKS (28 tickets, 22%)
   --------------------------------------
   - Waiting for scope clarification: 15 tickets blocked
   - Dependent on other scope changes: 13 tickets blocked

   Root Cause: 23 scope changes during project, some requiring clarification
   before work could proceed.
   Lesson: Establish scope change review process with defined SLAs.

4. ENVIRONMENT/TOOLING BLOCKS (16 tickets, 13%)
   ---------------------------------------------
   - CI/CD pipeline issues: 8 tickets blocked
   - Staging environment instability: 5 tickets blocked
   - Test data availability: 3 tickets blocked

   Root Cause: Infrastructure investment deferred early in project.
   Lesson: Invest in robust development infrastructure from day one.

5. RESOURCE/AVAILABILITY BLOCKS (10 tickets, 8%)
   ----------------------------------------------
   - Key person unavailable: 6 tickets blocked
   - Cross-team coordination: 4 tickets blocked

   Root Cause: Some critical knowledge not distributed across team.
   Lesson: Document tribal knowledge and cross-train on critical paths.

================================================================================
CRITICAL BLOCKING CHAINS
================================================================================

Chain 1: Multi-Tenant Cascade (14 tickets, 34 total days blocked)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
PHX-032 (Multi-tenant support) 
  └─> PHX-033 (Database refactor) - blocked 8 days
      └─> PHX-034 (Query updates) - blocked 12 days
          └─> PHX-056 (Tenant data leak fix) - blocked 5 days
              └─> 10 downstream tickets - blocked avg 3 days each

Impact: This single scope change created the longest blocking chain in the project.

Chain 2: Salesforce Integration (12 tickets, 28 total days blocked)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PHX-020 (Salesforce connector)
  └─> API access delays - blocked 15 days
      └─> PHX-241 (Sync feature) - blocked 8 days
          └─> PHX-245 (Error handling) - blocked 5 days

Impact: Integration started before API access confirmed. Team context-switched.

Chain 3: Workflow Automation (8 tickets, 21 total days blocked)
---------------------------------------------------------------
PHX-051 (Workflow automation engine)
  └─> PHX-052 (Rule engine design) - blocked 5 days for scope clarity
      └─> PHX-053 (Trigger system) - blocked 8 days
          └─> PHX-054-057 - blocked avg 2 days each

Impact: Late scope addition with unclear requirements.

================================================================================
TIMELINE OF MAJOR BLOCKS
================================================================================

May 2025:
- PHX-020 Salesforce integration blocked on API access (15 days)
- Team pivoted to other work, lost context

June 2025:
- Multi-tenant scope change (PHX-032) creates cascade
- 14 tickets enter blocked state over 2-week period

July 2025:
- Workflow automation scope change adds to backlog
- Peak blocking: 23 tickets blocked simultaneously (July 15)

August 2025:
- Security vulnerability discovery blocks all feature work (3 days)
- Performance issues discovered, emergency investigation

September-October 2025:
- Blocking issues largely resolved
- Average 3-5 tickets blocked at any time (acceptable)

November-December 2025:
- Minimal blocks during QA and launch phases
- Good execution on resolved architecture

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PROJECTS
================================================================================

1. DEPENDENCY VALIDATION SPRINT
   - Dedicate Sprint 0 to validating all external dependencies
   - No feature work until integrations are proven

2. SCOPE CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS
   - Require full dependency analysis for scope changes
   - Estimate blocking impact, not just direct work

3. ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS
   - Document decisions early to prevent mid-project pivots
   - Multi-tenancy should have been Sprint 1 decision

4. BLOCKING ESCALATION PROCESS
   - Escalate blocks > 3 days to project management
   - Weekly blocking review in standups

5. KNOWLEDGE DISTRIBUTION
   - No single-point-of-failure on any critical path
   - Pair programming on complex integrations
