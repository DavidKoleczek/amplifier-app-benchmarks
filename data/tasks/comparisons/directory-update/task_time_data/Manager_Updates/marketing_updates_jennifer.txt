Subject: Marketing Directory Updates - New Hire + Promotion

Hi!

Quick updates from Marketing:

NEW HIRE:
Priya Sharma started today (Jan 13) as our new Digital Marketing Specialist. She's reporting to me. Her info:
- Email: priya.sharma@techcorp.com
- Extension: 2030
- Location: Floor 2, desk 2G

PROMOTION:
Brandon Lee has been promoted to Senior Marketing Specialist effective January 1st. He's been doing amazing work on our content strategy and deserves the recognition.

CORRECTION:
I noticed Amanda Foster's extension is showing as 2028 but she's actually at 2029 now after the desk shuffle last month. Can we fix that?

Also - is there a way to add LinkedIn profiles to the directory? We've had a few clients ask for them. Just a thought for the future.

Thanks!
Jennifer
