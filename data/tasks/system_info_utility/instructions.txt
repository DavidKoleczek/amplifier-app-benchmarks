Create a Python command-line utility that prints the current machine's CPU core count and total RAM. The output must be exactly two lines in this format:

CPU Cores: <number>
RAM: <number> GB

Example output:
CPU Cores: 8
RAM: 16 GB

The RAM value should be in gigabytes (GB, decimal 1000-based) rounded to the nearest whole number.
