  We're finalizing our CRM vendor selection and need materials for the steering committee meeting next week.

  Create two deliverables:

  1. "CRM_Comparison.pptx" - A comprehensive vendor comparison presentation with:
     - Feature comparison across all three vendors
     - Pricing analysis and total cost of ownership
     - Security and compliance review
     - Pros/cons summary for each vendor
     - Risk assessment

  2. "CRM_Recommendation.docx" - A written recommendation document with:
     - Executive summary with clear recommendation
     - Evaluation methodology
     - Detailed justification for the recommendation
     - Implementation considerations
     - Dissenting opinions/risks of chosen vendor

  We're evaluating Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive. All the source materials are in this folder - RFP responses, demo feedback, pricing quotes, security questionnaires, and reference call notes. Synthesize everything into a clear recommendation.
