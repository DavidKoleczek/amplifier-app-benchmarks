Subject: Spring Campaign Recap - Key Messages for Board Presentation

Team,

As we finalize the Spring Campaign recap for next week's board meeting, I want to 
align on the key messages. This was a successful campaign and we should present it 
that way, while being appropriately transparent about challenges.

KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE:
--------------------------

1. OVERALL SUCCESS
   - $340K spend, ~$1.3M in attributed pipeline = strong ROI story
   - Beat awareness targets (50M+ impressions)
   - Generated 15K+ MQLs - our best quarter ever

2. CHANNEL PERFORMANCE
   - Google: Our workhorse. ROAS of 4.2x justifies the slight overspend.
   - LinkedIn: Punches above its weight for B2B. Higher CPL but better quality.
   - Influencer: TechReviewPro partnership was a win. 487K views speaks for itself.
   
3. WHAT WORKED
   - Launch timing was perfect (aligned with competitor's service issues)
   - Influencer strategy paid off - authentic content outperformed our ads
   - Email nurture converted at 3.4% - our best channel for closing

THINGS TO ADDRESS (but not dwell on):
-------------------------------------

1. GA TRACKING OUTAGE
   Present as: "We had a two-week data gap in April due to a technical issue. 
   We've since implemented automated monitoring to prevent recurrence."
   
   DO NOT present as: A major failure that invalidates our data.
   
   The social platform data and CRM give us confidence in the overall story, 
   even if we can't show day-by-day GA data for those two weeks.

2. A/B TEST RESULTS
   Present as: "Early results show promising lift from our new landing page design. 
   We'll continue testing to confirm."
   
   DO NOT present as: "Version B won" (we didn't hit statistical significance)
   DO NOT present as: "The test failed" (it was directionally positive)
   
   Marcus has concerns about the sample size. He's technically right, but for 
   board purposes, "promising early results" is accurate and appropriate.

3. TWITTER UNDERPERFORMANCE  
   Present as: "We reallocated budget from underperforming channels to maximize ROI."
   
   This is actually a success story about agile budget management, not a failure.

4. INFLUENCER OVERSPEND
   Present as: "We invested an additional $3,500 in our top-performing influencer 
   partnership based on strong early results."
   
   Tom may ask about this - be prepared to justify with TechReviewPro's numbers.

PIPELINE STORY (CFO's Focus):
-----------------------------

Tom specifically asked me to ensure we can connect spend to pipeline. The 
pipeline_sourced_from_campaign.csv shows $1.3M+ in total pipeline, with 
~$450K already closed.

Key stat: For every $1 we spent, we generated $3.80 in pipeline.

Yes, some of that pipeline is still in early stages, but the trajectory is strong.

VISUAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------------

For the deck:
- Lead with ROI (spend → pipeline → revenue)
- Channel breakdown as pie chart (shows diversification)
- Funnel visualization (shows full journey)
- Include 2-3 customer testimonials (Pinnacle, TechFlow, Seattle Cloud)
- One slide on learnings/next steps (shows maturity)

Whoever is building the deck - please make sure it tells a STORY, not just 
data dumps. We're proud of this campaign. Let's present it that way.

Let me know if you have questions. Happy to review drafts before Monday.

Jennifer
