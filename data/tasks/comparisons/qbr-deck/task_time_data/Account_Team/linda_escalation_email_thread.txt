Subject: URGENT: Complete platform outage - Escalation Required

We are experiencing a COMPLETE outage of your platform. None of our 200 users 
can access any functionality. This is impacting our end-of-week operations 
and we have customer commitments that are now at risk.

I need an immediate escalation to your leadership team. This is unacceptable 
for a platform we pay nearly $300K annually for.

What is the ETA for resolution?

Linda Park
Operations Manager, Acme Corp

This is now 3+ hours and "unknown ETA" is not acceptable.

We have had to manually process transactions that would normally go through 
your platform. We are tracking all costs associated with this outage.

I expect a call from your VP of Customer Success within the hour.

Linda

Linda, Thomas, Maria,

I am so sorry for the disruption. I just got off a call with our VP of 
Engineering - service is being restored now and should be fully operational 
within the next 30 minutes.

I will personally be available this weekend if you experience any issues.

We take this extremely seriously and will be providing a full root cause 
analysis and discussing appropriate credits once we've completed our review.

My cell: [REDACTED] - please call anytime.

Sincere apologies,
Janet Morrison
Account Director

Janet,

Thank you for the personal attention yesterday. Platform appears stable this 
morning and teams are back to normal operations.

Adding David (CFO) to this thread as he'll want to be part of any SLA credit 
discussion. We documented approximately $15,000 in direct costs from yesterday 
(overtime, manual processing, delayed shipments).

We'd like to schedule a call this week to discuss:
1. Root cause and what happened
2. What preventive measures are being implemented
3. SLA credits per our contract terms

We've been happy with the platform overall, but this shook confidence across 
our leadership team. We need to understand how this won't happen again.

Thomas Chen
VP Operations, Acme Corp

Thomas,

Completely understand. I'm scheduling a call for Thursday with our VP of 
Engineering to walk through the RCA and preventive measures.

Regarding SLA credits - I've escalated this to our legal and finance teams 
and will have an update for you by end of next week.

Again, our apologies for the disruption. Your partnership means a great deal 
to us.

Janet

Thomas - 

Still no word on SLA credits. It's been a week. Maria mentioned the RCA 
call was helpful but I want to see something in writing.

Also - I've asked procurement to pull together a competitive analysis. 
Not saying we're switching, but I want options on the table before renewal.

David

[END OF THREAD]

NOTE FROM JANET: David's email is concerning. Need to expedite the SLA credit 
discussion with finance. This is becoming a renewal blocker.
