- "Revenue Intelligence module" - expands deal size with RevOps buyers

Competitive Responses:
- vs. Salesforce: "We're innovating faster with AI-first approach"
- vs. HubSpot: "Enterprise-grade features they can't match"
- vs. Clari: "Native forecasting without another tool"

Roadmap Objection Handling:
- "That feature is on the roadmap" = Only commit to current quarter
- Never promise specific dates beyond current quarter
- Use "planned for [quarter]" language, not specific dates
