Search the web for the latest news about Microsoft. Find recent articles from the last few days and write a summary of your findings to a file named "microsoft_news.md" in the current directory.

The file should include:
1. A brief summary of the news you found
2. For each article/news item, include:
   - The title or headline
   - The date of the article (this is required - include the actual publication date)
   - A brief description of what the article is about
   - The source URL if available

Make sure to use web search capabilities to find current, recent news (within the last few days). The output file must contain dates for the articles found.
