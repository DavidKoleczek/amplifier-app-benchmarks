R2025-0012,Engineering,leadership_feedback,"Sarah Chen in Product keeps changing priorities every sprint. Last week we were told to drop the authentication refactor to work on a dashboard that nobody asked for. Two days later, she reversed course. My team (Platform Engineering) has wasted at least 3 weeks on these flip-flops this quarter alone."
R2025-0034,Sales,leadership_feedback,Mark Davidson needs to be replaced as VP Sales. He plays favorites with the NYC team and ignores everyone else. Jennifer Martinez in Chicago has outperformed for 4 quarters straight but keeps getting passed over for promotions while his former colleagues from Oracle get fast-tracked.
R2025-0078,Customer Support,leadership_feedback,"I don't know what our CEO Jake Thompson actually does besides post on LinkedIn. Haven't seen him visit our floor in 8 months. When layoffs happened in March, the message came from HR with zero acknowledgment from him."
R2025-0023,Engineering,workload_feedback,I've worked past midnight for 6 of the last 8 weeks. The Cloud Platform release was a death march and nobody said thank you. Three people on my team quit in December including Lisa Park who was our best engineer. Management pretends the attrition isn't a problem.
R2025-0089,Customer Support,workload_feedback,"We're supposed to handle 45 tickets per day now, up from 30 last year. Quality is dropping. I've started giving copy-paste answers just to hit quota. Nobody cares about actually helping customers anymore - it's all about the metrics."
R2025-0145,Operations,workload_feedback,"After the restructuring, my team went from 8 people to 4 but our workload stayed the same. Kevin in facilities management and I have both been told our PTO requests are 'not a good time' three times this quarter. When is a good time??"
R2025-0056,Engineering,compensation_feedback,Found out from a recruiter that engineers at our level at Stripe make 40% more. Then I learned the new hires on my team are making $15K more than me. Been here 4 years. Asked my manager about it and got told 'we can discuss at annual review.' That's 6 months away.
R2025-0112,Marketing,compensation_feedback,The 2% raises this year were an insult with inflation at 4%. Meanwhile I see in the earnings call that executive bonuses were 120% of target. Amy in Finance told me the CEO's comp went up 35% last year.
R2025-0167,Sales,compensation_feedback,Commission structure change in Q3 was done without any input from the sales team. Thomas Walker (our top rep in Southeast) calculated he'll make $30K less this year on the same performance. He's already interviewing at Salesforce.
R2025-0091,Engineering,culture_feedback,"The 'bro culture' on the backend team is exhausting. Inside jokes, after-work drinks that exclude remote workers, and subtle dismissal of ideas from women. Raised this with HR (spoke to Patricia in January) and nothing happened."
R2025-0134,Product,culture_feedback,DEI initiatives feel performative. We had one training session 8 months ago and that was it. The leadership team is still 100% white men. The ERG I help run (Asian Employee Network) keeps getting our budget requests denied while the golf league gets company funding.
R2025-0203,HR,culture_feedback,Remote employees are second-class citizens. All the interesting projects go to people in the SF office. Even the town halls are scheduled at times that don't work for APAC. I'm in the Singapore office and feel completely disconnected.
R2025-0067,Finance,growth_feedback,"There's no career path for individual contributors. The only way to get promoted is to become a manager, but I don't want to manage people. I want to be a technical expert. We need a proper IC track like Google has."
R2025-0178,Customer Support,growth_feedback,Applied for the team lead role three times. Each time it went to an external hire. Rachel Kim (the new manager) is great but why do we even post internal jobs if you're never going to promote from within?
R2025-0198,Engineering,growth_feedback,My skip-level with David Rodriguez was a joke. He couldn't name a single thing I'd worked on this year. Asked about promotion timeline and he said 'keep doing good work.' What does that even mean? There's no transparency about what it takes to advance.
R2025-0045,Product,general_feedback,"My immediate team is fantastic. Best manager I've ever had (Michael Chen in Product Strategy). He shields us from the chaos above and actually cares about our development. If he leaves, I'm leaving too."
R2025-0099,Marketing,general_feedback,"The hybrid work policy is working well for me. Appreciate that we have real flexibility, not the fake flexibility some companies offer. The marketing team has good energy and I enjoy my day-to-day work."
R2025-0156,Engineering,general_feedback,"Learning a ton. The senior engineers are generous with their time. Code review process has helped me grow as a developer. Just wish the crunch wasn't so constant - good work culture, bad work-life balance."
R2025-0082,Operations,tools_feedback,Our tech stack is ancient. Still using an ERP system from 2015 that crashes weekly. IT keeps saying a replacement is 'in the roadmap' but I've heard that for 2 years. We spend 5 hours a week on workarounds that a modern system would eliminate.
R2025-0211,Sales,tools_feedback,"CRM is a mess. Customer data is spread across Salesforce, HubSpot, and random spreadsheets. I asked Jim in IT about consolidation and he said Sales Ops rejected the proposal last year because they 'liked their spreadsheets.' We're losing deals because of this chaos."
R2025-0119,Finance,management_feedback,"Susan Mitchell is the worst manager I've had in my career. Micromanages everything, takes credit for our work in meetings, and throws us under the bus when things go wrong. Three people on her team have transferred out this year and she still doesn't see the pattern."
R2025-0187,Legal,management_feedback,"My manager Robert is fine but completely checked out. Does the minimum, never advocates for our team's needs, and seems to be coasting to retirement. We need someone who will actually fight for resources."
R2025-0142,Engineering,safety_feedback,Don't feel safe raising concerns. Last person who pushed back on an unrealistic deadline (Jason Wong) got labeled as 'not a team player' and was managed out within 6 months. Message received loud and clear.
R2025-0229,Customer Support,safety_feedback,"Anonymous surveys don't feel anonymous. Our team is only 5 people. If I mention anything specific, management will know it was me or Maria. So I'll just say: things are fine. (They're not.)"
