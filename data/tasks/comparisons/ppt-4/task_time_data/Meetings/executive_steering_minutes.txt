1. PROJECT STATUS REVIEW
======================================================

James Chen presented current status:

COMPLETED:
- Core platform (authentication, dashboard, reporting)
- Multi-tenant architecture (scope change #1)
- Custom field support (scope change #2)
- Notification system
- Search and filtering
- 65% of workflow automation (scope change #3)

IN PROGRESS:
- Workflow automation completion
- SSO integration (scope change #4)
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

REMAINING:
- Data retention policies (scope change #5 - pending)
- QA cycle
- UAT
- Production deployment

Susan Walsh: "James, let's be direct. Are we going to hit November 28th?"

James Chen: "If there are no additional scope changes and we get timely UAT 
feedback, yes. But we have minimal buffer."

Thomas Park: "We're committed to no more scope changes after the retention 
policy requirement. That's the last one."

======================================================
2. TIMELINE DISCUSSION
======================================================

Marcus Thompson: "Walk me through how we went from September 1st to 
November 28th."

James Chen provided breakdown:
- Original scope (September 1st target): On track through Sprint 5
- Multi-tenant addition (+6 weeks): May 28 approval
- Custom fields (+4 weeks): June 25 approval  
- Workflow automation (+8 weeks): July 20 approval
- SSO requirement (+3 weeks): September 12 approval
- Data retention (+2 weeks): October 10 approval (pending)
- Bug fixes and rework (+3 weeks): Cumulative impact

Total slip: 14 weeks (some overlap due to parallel work)

Linda Chen: "Were these scope changes estimated before approval?"

James Chen: "Initially, no. We started impact analysis after the multi-tenant 
change. The later changes have documented estimates."

Linda Chen: "So we learned mid-project."

James Chen: "Yes. Expensive lesson."

Marcus Thompson: "The pattern I see is we said yes to scope without adjusting 
timeline expectations. That's a process failure."

Susan Walsh: "Agreed. We'll address that separately. Today I need to know 
if November 28th holds."

James Chen: "I'm confident if we maintain scope freeze."

======================================================
3. BUDGET REVIEW
======================================================

Marcus Thompson reviewed financials:

ORIGINAL CONTRACT: $840,000
APPROVED CHANGE ORDERS: $336,000 (as of this meeting)
REVISED CONTRACT: $1,176,000
PROJECTED FINAL: $1,176,000 (on budget for revised scope)

Marcus Thompson: "The project is 40% over original budget, but within approved 
scope changes. From a financial controls perspective, we're clean."

Susan Walsh: "And the client approved each change order?"

Marcus Thompson: "Correct. Documented and signed."

Thomas Park: "We know we asked for more. We're willing to pay for it. Our 
concern is delivery, not cost."

======================================================
4. CLIENT CONCERNS
======================================================

Thomas Park presented TechCorp perspective:

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
1. Date certainty - "We've heard November before. We need it to stick."
2. Quality assurance - "The security issue in August was concerning."
3. Communication gaps - "We learned about delays after decisions were made."

WHAT'S WORKING:
1. Product quality - "Demos have been impressive."
2. Technical team - "David and Sarah are excellent."
3. Responsiveness - "When issues arise, they're addressed quickly."

Thomas Park: "Robert will join shortly. He wants to hear directly that 
November 28th is committed."

Susan Walsh: "I'll make that commitment personally."

[Robert Martinez joined at 3:45 PM]

Robert Martinez: "Susan, thank you for making time. I'll be brief. I have a 
board meeting in January. I need Phoenix live and stable by then. Can you 
guarantee November 28th?"

Susan Walsh: "Robert, I'm committing to November 28th delivery. James and his 
team have my full support and resources. If anything threatens that date, 
I will know immediately, and so will you."

Robert Martinez: "That's what I needed to hear. Thomas will work with James on 
the details. Thank you."

[Robert Martinez left at 3:55 PM]
