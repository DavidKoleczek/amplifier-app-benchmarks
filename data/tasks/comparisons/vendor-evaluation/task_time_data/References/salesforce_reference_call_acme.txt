QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:

Q: Why did you choose Salesforce over alternatives?

Jennifer: We evaluated HubSpot and Microsoft Dynamics back in 2020. Honestly, 
it came down to scale and compliance. We're in industrial manufacturing with 
government contracts, so we needed FedRAMP-ready infrastructure. Salesforce 
was the only one that checked that box. HubSpot was actually our sales team's 
preference for usability, but IT vetoed it on security grounds.


Q: How was the implementation experience?

Jennifer: Longer than quoted. They said 16 weeks, we went 24. Part of that 
was on us - scope creep, couldn't get stakeholders aligned, data cleanup 
took forever. But their team also underestimated our complexity. The 
professional services bill came in about 40% over original quote.

That said, once we were live, it worked. No major issues post go-live.


Q: What's your honest assessment of user adoption?

Jennifer: Mixed. Power users love it - our sales ops team, managers, 
forecasting people. They couldn't live without it now. Regular sales reps? 
Maybe 60% are actually using it properly. The rest do the minimum to not 
get in trouble.

The mobile app is a sore point. Reps say it's too slow in the field. 
They've resorted to taking notes on their phones and entering later, 
which defeats the purpose.


Q: Any surprise costs or gotchas?

Jennifer: A few:
1. Storage overages - we hit our limit year 2, had to buy more
2. The good AI features (Einstein) are extra - we thought they were included
3. Training is ongoing - new hires need real training, not just "figure it out"
4. We ended up hiring a full-time Salesforce admin by year 2

All-in, we're probably paying 30% more than the original quote when you 
add everything up.


Q: How's the support?

Jennifer: Support is good when you need it. Premier Success has been worth 
it - we have a named CSM who knows our setup. Response times are reasonable 
for non-critical issues. Critical issues we've had (twice in 4 years) were 
resolved within hours.


Q: Any regrets? Would you choose Salesforce again?

Jennifer: Regrets... I wish we'd pushed back harder on scope during 
implementation. We tried to do too much at once. Should have started 
simpler and added features over time.

Would I choose it again? For our size and compliance needs, yes, probably. 
But if we were smaller - say under 200 users - I'd seriously look at 
HubSpot. Salesforce is a lot of firepower. Make sure you need it.


Q: Advice for a company our size (150 users)?

Jennifer: Three things:

1. Be honest about your actual needs. Don't buy features you won't use. 
   We have CPQ and barely use half of it.

2. Budget 25-30% over quoted implementation costs. Plan for overruns.

3. Have a plan for adoption. The best CRM is useless if people don't use it.
   Tie usage to something meaningful (compensation, visibility, etc.)

Also - really push your sales team to test the mobile app. That's been our 
biggest complaint and I wish we'd caught it earlier.


Q: Any other vendors you've looked at since?

Jennifer: We looked at dumping Service Cloud for Zendesk (cheaper, better 
for our support team) but the integration headaches weren't worth it. 
Once you're in Salesforce, you tend to stay in Salesforce. That's both 
good and bad.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:

Jennifer was candid and helpful. Key takeaways:
- Implementation overruns are common (plan for 30%+ buffer)
- Adoption is a real challenge, especially for field reps
- Mobile experience is weak point
- Once in, switching cost is high
- For enterprise/compliance needs, still the go-to choice
- For smaller orgs without strict compliance, consider alternatives

She offered to connect us with their Salesforce admin if we have 
technical questions.
