ACTIVE PROJECTS
================================================================================

PROJECT: Prism Platform Launch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status: IN PROGRESS (Yellow)
Target Launch: February 15, 2026
Owner: Marcus Williams
Budget: $450,000 (Q4+Q1 combined)
Budget Spent: $287,000 (64%)

Workstreams:
| Workstream          | Status    | % Complete | Owner        | Due Date  | Notes                    |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Core API            | On Track  | 80%        | Marcus W.    | Jan 31    |                          |
| Authentication      | At Risk   | 70%        | Chen L.      | Jan 20    | Waiting security audit   |
| Dashboard           | On Track  | 75%        | Kim A.       | Feb 5     |                          |
| Android SDK         | Complete  | 100%       | Dev Team     | Done      | Completed Jan 3          |
| iOS SDK             | At Risk   | 60%        | Contractor   | Feb 20    | Chen medical leave impact|
| Documentation       | On Track  | 50%        | Tech Writing | Feb 10    |                          |

Key Risks:
1. iOS SDK delay - contractor ramp-up slower than expected
2. Security audit timing - results due Jan 17, any findings could delay launch
3. Team bandwidth - multiple team members working overtime

Blockers:
- Security audit results (ETA: Jan 17)

Notes:
- Requirements gathering needed from Sales team
