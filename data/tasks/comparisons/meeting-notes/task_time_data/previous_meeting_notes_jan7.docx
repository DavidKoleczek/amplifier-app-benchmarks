================================================================================

1. PRISM DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

Marcus provided status update on Prism development:
- Core API development is on track, approximately 75% complete
- Authentication module entering final testing phase
- Security audit scheduled for week of January 13
- Mobile SDK progress:
  * Android: 90% complete, on track for early Feb
  * iOS: Delayed due to Chen's medical leave; currently at 60%
  * Contractor hired to backfill but ramping up slowly

Key concern: iOS timeline at risk. Marcus estimates 3-4 week delay possible.

Decision: Monitor iOS progress daily. Escalate to David if no improvement by Jan 14.

2. LAUNCH DATE DISCUSSION

Original target: February 15, 2026
Current assessment: At risk due to iOS delays

Options discussed:
a) Push entire launch to March 1
b) Phased launch (web first, mobile later)
c) Launch without iOS initially

No decision made - to be revisited January 14 when David returns.

Jennifer presented draft campaign timeline:
- Teaser campaign: Feb 1-14
- Launch announcement: Feb 15
- Press push: Feb 15-28
