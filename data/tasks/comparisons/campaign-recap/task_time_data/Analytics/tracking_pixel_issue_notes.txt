INCIDENT REPORT: Google Analytics Tracking Pixel Failure
=========================================================

Incident ID: INC-2025-0411
Reported By: Marcus Webb, Digital Analytics
Date Identified: April 25, 2025
Date Resolved: April 25, 2025

TIMELINE:
---------
April 11, 2025 (approx 2:30 AM): Website deployment pushed new header template
April 11, 2025 (8:45 AM): Marketing noticed zero sessions in real-time GA
April 11, 2025 (9:15 AM): Ticket escalated to Engineering
April 11, 2025 (11:30 AM): Root cause identified - GA snippet accidentally removed
April 11, 2025 (2:00 PM): Fix deployed to staging
April 14, 2025 (9:00 AM): Fix deployed to production (delayed due to weekend)
April 25, 2025 (10:30 AM): ACTUAL fix confirmed working (previous fix was incomplete)

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
During the April 10th website update, a junior developer accidentally deleted the 
Google Analytics tracking snippet from the base template. The initial "fix" on 
April 14th only partially restored tracking - it was missing the enhanced ecommerce
module. This wasn't caught until April 25th when we noticed conversion data was
still missing.

IMPACT:
-------
- 14 days of missing/incomplete Google Analytics data (April 11-24)
- Affected data:
  * All session/user metrics
  * Goal completions
  * Ecommerce transactions
  * Event tracking
  * Attribution data

- NOT affected:
  * Social platform native analytics (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)
  * Email platform metrics (Marketo)
  * CRM data (Salesforce lead tracking)
  * Server-side transaction logs

DATA RECOVERY ATTEMPTS:
-----------------------
1. Server logs: Retrieved basic pageview counts, but no user identification
2. Facebook Pixel: Still working - can cross-reference FB-attributed traffic
3. Marketo: Email clicks still tracked properly
4. Salesforce: Lead source data intact from UTM parameters

ESTIMATED IMPACT ON CAMPAIGN METRICS:
-------------------------------------
Based on traffic patterns before/after outage:
- Estimated missed sessions: ~45,000-55,000
- Estimated missed conversions: 180-220
- Estimated missed revenue tracking: $55,000-$70,000

Note: These are ESTIMATES based on extrapolation. Actual numbers cannot be recovered.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPORTING:
------------------------------
1. Flag all April data as incomplete
2. Use social platform native data as primary source for April 11-24
3. Consider showing two views: "Tracked Data" vs "Estimated Total"
4. CFO has been briefed - expects asterisks in any April reporting

PREVENTIVE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------------------
1. Added automated GA tracking verification to deployment pipeline
2. Set up real-time alerting for GA data drops
3. Created backup tracking via server-side logging
4. Added code review requirement for template changes
