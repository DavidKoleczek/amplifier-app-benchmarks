CURRENT ISSUES

- C1: Trail Mix

STUCK/BROKEN:

  - Note: This is the 3rd time this month. Can we get it serviced?

WRONG ITEMS:

RANDOM COMPLAINTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The coffee machine next to Machine A makes a "concerning noise"
- Someone keeps taking the last of everything and not reporting it
- The ice maker is doing that thing again
- Why is there a vending machine in Building B but no snack options 
  in Building C? Building C feels forgotten.

1. Emergency restock of Kind Bars and Cheez-Its
2. Service call for Machine A (jammed slot A7)
3. Correct the Diet Coke situation
