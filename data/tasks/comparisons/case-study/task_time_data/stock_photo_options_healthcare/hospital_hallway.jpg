Notes from marketing:
"Good for background/texture if we need generic healthcare imagery. The HealthFirst 
lobby photo is better for actual case study use since it's authentic. Keeping this 
as backup option."

Potential uses:
- Presentation background
- Website header image
- Social media graphics
- Brochure design elements

Decision: Probably won't use - HealthFirst provided real photos
