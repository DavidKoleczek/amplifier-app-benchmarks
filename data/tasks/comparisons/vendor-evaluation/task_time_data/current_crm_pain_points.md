# Why We're Switching CRMs
## Current State Pain Points Analysis

**Compiled by:** Mike Torres (VP Sales) & Sarah Chen (IT Director)  
**Date:** October 15, 2025

## Background

We've been running on a combination of spreadsheets, Mailchimp, and a legacy CRM (SugarCRM self-hosted) for 6 years. It's broken. This document captures why we need to change.

---

## The Big Picture Problem

**We have no single source of truth for customer data.**

- Sales tracks deals in spreadsheets (each rep has their own)
- Marketing has contacts in Mailchimp (often duplicated)
- Finance has customers in NetSuite
- Support has tickets in Zendesk
- Leadership has no visibility into pipeline

**Result:** We don't actually know our pipeline. Forecasting is guesswork. We've lost deals because two reps were working the same account.

---

## Pain Point #1: Spreadsheet Chaos

### What's Happening
Each sales rep maintains their own Excel/Google Sheet with:
- Contact list
- Deal tracking
- Activity notes
- Follow-up reminders

### Why It's a Problem
- **No visibility:** Managers can't see pipeline without asking each rep
- **No history:** When a rep leaves, their knowledge leaves
- **No accuracy:** Forecasts are "best guesses"
- **No accountability:** Easy to hide struggling deals
- **Duplicate work:** Multiple reps pursuing same accounts

### Real Example
*Q3 2025: Two reps both working General Electric, unaware of each other. We looked unprofessional and lost the deal.*

### What We Need
A single system where all deals live, all activity is logged, and anyone with permission can see the pipeline.

---

## Pain Point #2: Marketing-Sales Disconnect

### What's Happening
Marketing runs campaigns in Mailchimp. Leads come in. Someone manually adds them to a spreadsheet. Maybe. Sometimes leads get lost.

### Why It's a Problem
- **Lead leakage:** We've found leads in Mailchimp never followed up
- **No attribution:** Can't tie revenue back to marketing campaigns
- **No scoring:** All leads treated equally regardless of engagement
- **Manual handoff:** Error-prone, slow, incomplete data

### Real Example
*Marketing ran a webinar with 200 registrants. Only 50 made it to sales sheets. 150 leads lost.*

### What We Need
Marketing and sales in the same system. Leads auto-routed. Engagement tracked. Attribution clear.

---

## Pain Point #3: SugarCRM is Dead

### What's Happening
We implemented SugarCRM Community Edition in 2019. It was cheap. It's now:
- Running on outdated PHP
- No longer receiving security patches
- Difficult to customize
- Hated by sales (slow, clunky UI)
- Not mobile friendly
- Integration-challenged

### Why It's a Problem
- **Security risk:** Unpatched vulnerabilities
- **Adoption:** Sales refuses to use it (hence the spreadsheets)
- **Integration:** Can't connect to modern tools (no REST API)
- **Mobile:** Desktop-only in 2025 is unacceptable
- **Support:** No vendor support, in-house only

### Real Example
*IT spent 40 hours last quarter patching security holes. Still got flagged in audit.*

### What We Need
Modern, cloud-based CRM with vendor support, security certifications, and mobile apps.

---

## Pain Point #4: Zero Pipeline Visibility

### What's Happening
When leadership asks "what's the pipeline?" the answer takes 3 days:
1. Mike asks each rep for their spreadsheet
2. Ops consolidates and cleans data
3. Someone builds a report
4. Data is already stale

### Why It's a Problem
- **Forecasting:** Board asks, we guess
- **Resource planning:** Can't staff for deals we can't see
- **Coaching:** Managers can't help without visibility
- **Accountability:** Deals hide until they're lost

### Real Example
*Q2 board meeting: Projected $2.4M, closed $1.9M. 20% miss. Board not happy.*

### What We Need
Real-time pipeline dashboard. Accurate forecasts. Stage-by-stage visibility.

---

## Pain Point #5: Mobile is Non-Existent

### What's Happening
Sales reps are in the field. They meet with clients. Notes go on paper or phone notes app. Maybe get entered later. Usually don't.

### Why It's a Problem
- **Lost intelligence:** Meeting insights not captured
- **Delayed updates:** Deals updated days after changes
- **No real-time:** Can't check customer history before meetings
- **Frustration:** Reps feel CRM is "extra work"

### Real Example
*Rep met with prospect, learned competitor was in final negotiations. Didn't log it. We found out when we lost.*

### What We Need
Mobile app that's fast enough to use between meetings. Voice notes. Instant sync.

---

## Pain Point #6: Customer Handoff Failures

### What's Happening
When a deal closes, there's no clean handoff to customer success or support.
- Sales knows the context
- CS gets a forwarded email
- Support has no history
- Customer repeats themselves

### Why It's a Problem
- **Customer experience:** "I already told your colleague this"
- **Onboarding:** Starts from scratch every time
- **Churn risk:** Customers feel like a number, not a relationship
- **Upsell:** No visibility into expansion opportunities

### What We Need
Complete customer history visible to all teams. Clean handoff workflows.

---

## Pain Point #7: No Analytics or Insights

### What's Happening
We have no idea:
- Win rate by rep, region, or industry
- Average deal cycle
- Conversion rates by stage
- Which marketing channels produce revenue
- Why we lose deals

### Why It's a Problem
- **Blind decisions:** Strategy based on gut, not data
- **No improvement:** Can't fix what we can't measure
- **Wasted investment:** Don't know what's working

### What We Need
Reporting built-in. Dashboards. Trend analysis. AI insights would be a bonus.

---

## The Business Impact

### Quantifiable Losses
- **Lost deals due to coordination failures:** ~$150K (Q1-Q3 2025)
- **Marketing leads never followed up:** Est. $200K opportunity cost
- **Forecast misses affecting planning:** Unmeasurable but significant
- **IT time maintaining SugarCRM:** 120 hours/year = $15K

### Qualitative Impact
- Sales team morale is low (frustration with tools)
- Leadership trust in forecasts is eroding
- Customer experience is inconsistent
- We look unprofessional to sophisticated buyers

---

## What Success Looks Like

6 months post-implementation:
1. Single source of truth for all customer data
2. Marketing leads auto-flow to sales
3. Pipeline visible in real-time
4. Mobile app actually used by reps
5. Forecasts within 10% accuracy
6. Customer handoffs are clean
7. We can answer "why did we win/lose?"

---

## Summary

We're not looking for a "nice to have" upgrade. We're fixing a broken foundation that's costing us revenue, efficiency, and credibility.

**The right CRM is an investment, not an expense.**
