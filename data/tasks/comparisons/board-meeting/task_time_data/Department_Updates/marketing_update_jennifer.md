## Competitive Intelligence Update

**Note:** I want to flag something concerning here. David mentioned in his update that we have "zero critical bugs" but I'm hearing different feedback from the market.

### What We're Hearing from Prospects
- 3 prospects mentioned hearing about "stability issues" with NexusAI
- Kinaxis sales team is apparently using FUD about our funding situation
- One prospect said a competitor shared "screenshots of NexusAI error messages"

### My Concern
I'm not sure where this is coming from, but there may be negative word-of-mouth we need to address. Either there ARE issues we're not tracking, or competitors are spreading misinformation. Either way, we need a response strategy.

**Recommendation:** Customer reference program + proactive case studies to counter FUD.
