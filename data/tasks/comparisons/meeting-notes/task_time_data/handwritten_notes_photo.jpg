Q1 Planning - Jan 14
---

Prism launch:
- API 80% done
- Security audit -> Fri (1/17)
- Marcus says Feb 15 is "aggressive"
- iOS behind - Chen out sick, contractor didn't work
- Android DONE

Phased launch idea (David):
  Web: Feb 15
  Mobile: end of Feb (28th?)
  
* contingent on security audit *

Tom: 70% deals don't need mobile day 1
     Meridian DOES need it

Jennifer - soft launch Feb 15
         - big press when mobile ready
