Notes from marketing:
"This could work for the hero image if we don't use the actual HealthFirst photos. 
Generic enough to represent 'healthcare success' without being specific to HealthFirst.
Need to decide if authentic photos are better than polished stock."

Decision pending: Use real photos from HealthFirst or supplement with stock?
