Hi David!

Hope this email finds you well! I came across your profile on LinkedIn and 
was BLOWN AWAY by your experience. You seem like exactly the kind of leader 
who would appreciate top-tier talent!

I'm Jason from TalentFinders, and I wanted to reach out because we have some 
INCREDIBLE senior engineer candidates who just became available. These are 
PASSIVE candidates who aren't on the market yet - but for the right opportunity, 
they'd move!

Here's what we have:

🌟 CANDIDATE A - "The Unicorn"
   - 15 years experience at FAANG companies
   - Built systems serving 500M users
   - Available immediately (totally not made up)
   - Salary expectations: "Competitive" (TBD)

🌟 CANDIDATE B - "The 10x Engineer"  
   - Literally invented microservices (citation needed)
   - Can code in 47 programming languages
   - References include Elon Musk (unverified)
   - Will definitely pass your technical interview

🌟 CANDIDATE C - "The Culture Fit"
   - Loves ping pong and free snacks
   - Has strong opinions about tabs vs spaces
   - Brings their own mechanical keyboard
   - Team player (according to their mom)

Our placement fee is only 25% of first-year salary - a STEAL compared to 
the competition! And if you sign up TODAY, we'll throw in a free resume 
review for your team!

I'd love to set up a quick 30-minute call to discuss your hiring needs. 
How does tomorrow at 7 AM work? Or Thursday at 11 PM? I'm flexible!

Looking forward to partnering with you!

Best regards,
Jason Mitchell

P.S. - I'll follow up in 2 hours if I don't hear back. And then again tomorrow. 
And the day after. And next week. I'm VERY persistent! 💪

P.P.S. - Please connect with me on LinkedIn! I only have 4,000 connections 
and I'm trying to hit 5,000 by end of year!
