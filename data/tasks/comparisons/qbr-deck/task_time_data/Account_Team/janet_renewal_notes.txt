ACME CORP RENEWAL NOTES
=======================
Account Manager: Janet Morrison
Last Updated: January 8, 2026

RENEWAL OVERVIEW
----------------
Current Contract End: March 31, 2026
Contract Value: $287,500 ARR
Renewal Target: Q1 2026 (ideally close by end of February)

STATUS: YELLOW - Requires attention

KEY CONTACTS
------------
- Thomas Chen, VP Operations (Executive Sponsor) - relationship is solid
- Maria Santos, IT Director (Technical Champion) - concerned about Nov incident
- David Park, CFO - controls budget, has been quiet lately

RENEWAL CONVERSATION NOTES
--------------------------
Dec 12 call with Thomas:
- Overall satisfied with platform, team loves the collaboration features
- BUT the November outage came up immediately
- He said "David [CFO] is asking questions about our vendor relationships"
- Wants to see reliability data in the QBR
- Mentioned they're getting pitched by competitors

Dec 18 email from Maria:
- Forwarded an internal IT audit request about platform stability
- Asked for RCA document (I sent the sanitized version, not the full one)
- She's supportive but under pressure from her team

RENEWAL RISKS
-------------
1. November outage still top of mind - need to show it was isolated
2. CFO involvement suggests budget scrutiny
3. Competitor activity - heard they're looking at alternatives (TBD which ones)

EXPANSION OPPORTUNITY
---------------------
Thomas mentioned they're expanding the West Coast office (50 new seats)
If we nail the QBR and address concerns, could be $42K expansion on top of renewal

ACTION ITEMS FOR QBR
--------------------
[ ] Show strong usage growth (we have the data - use it!)
[ ] Address support ticket spike honestly but with context
[ ] DO NOT dwell on the outage - acknowledge briefly, pivot to improvements
[ ] Highlight upcoming product features they've requested
[ ] Get Thomas aligned before the CFO joins

TIMING NOTE
-----------
I originally told the team renewal was Q2, but contract actually ends Q1. 
Need to move faster than planned. QBR is critical.
