NOTES ON TECHREVIEWPRO PARTNERSHIP:
-----------------------------------
Original budget was $12,000. Mid-campaign (April 18), we negotiated additional 
$3,000 for extended promotion period after seeing strong early results.

Some internal debate on whether this was worth it:
- Marketing (Jennifer): "Absolutely worth it - 487K views, great engagement"
- Finance (Tom): "ROI unclear - can't directly attribute sales to influencer"
- Sales (David): "Anecdotally hearing customers mention seeing the video"

For the recap, recommend showing the spend but noting attribution is soft.
CFO asked specifically about this line item in last week's meeting.

Note: "Est. Conv" is estimated based on UTM tracking. Not all clicks used trackable links.
TechReviewPro specifically asked to use their own redirect link for "authenticity" -
this makes attribution harder but was a condition of the partnership.
