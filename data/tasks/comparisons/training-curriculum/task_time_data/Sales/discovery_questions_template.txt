DISCOVERY CALL TEMPLATE
=======================
Use this framework for initial discovery calls.
Adjust based on conversation flow - don't read like a script!

PREP (Before the call)
======================
[ ] Research company (size, industry, recent news)
[ ] Check LinkedIn for attendees
[ ] Review any previous interactions in CRM
[ ] Prepare 2-3 company-specific questions
[ ] Test screen share and audio

OPENING (2-3 minutes)
=====================
"Thanks for taking the time today. Before we dive in, I'd love to
understand more about your world so I can make this relevant for you.
I have some questions, but feel free to jump in with anything."

Set agenda:
"Here's what I was thinking - I'd love to spend the first 20 minutes
understanding your current situation and challenges. Then I can show
you a few things that might be relevant. Does that work?"

CURRENT STATE (5-7 minutes)
===========================
Goal: Understand how they operate today

[ ] "Walk me through how your sales team manages pipeline today."

[ ] "What tools are you currently using?"
    - If they name a CRM: "How long have you been on that? How's it working?"
    - If they say spreadsheets: "What made you look at alternatives now?"

[ ] "How many reps are on the team? What's the typical deal size?"

[ ] "What does your sales process look like - stages, typical cycle time?"

PAIN IDENTIFICATION (8-10 minutes)
==================================
Goal: Find specific pain and quantify impact

FORECASTING:
[ ] "How accurate would you say your forecasts have been this year?"
[ ] "What happens when forecasts are off? Who feels that?"
[ ] "How much time does your team spend on forecasting activities?"

PIPELINE VISIBILITY:
[ ] "How do you know which deals are healthy vs. at risk?"
[ ] "When was the last time a deal slipped unexpectedly? What happened?"
[ ] "What visibility do managers have into rep activity?"

PROCESS & TOOLS:
[ ] "What's the biggest frustration with your current tools?"
[ ] "How much time do reps spend on data entry vs. selling?"
[ ] "What would you change if you could wave a magic wand?"

IMPACT QUANTIFICATION:
[ ] "What's the cost of an inaccurate forecast for your business?"
[ ] "If reps had 2 more hours per day for selling, what would that mean?"
[ ] "What's at stake if you don't solve this?"

THE THREE WHYS
==============
When you hear a pain point, go deeper:

1. Surface: "We struggle with forecast accuracy."
   → "Why is that a problem?" (business impact)

2. Business: "We miss our numbers and lose credibility with the board."
   → "Why does that matter?" (personal impact)

3. Personal: "I've missed my bonus twice and my job feels at risk."
   → Now you have real urgency.

DECISION PROCESS (5 minutes)
============================
Goal: Understand how they buy

[ ] "If you saw something you liked, what would the process look like to move forward?"

[ ] "Who else would be involved in this decision?"
    - "Anyone from IT/Security/Finance?"
    - "Who has budget authority?"

[ ] "What's your timeline? Is there an event driving this?"

[ ] "What would need to be true for you to move forward this quarter?"

[ ] "Are you looking at other solutions? Who else is on your list?"

TRANSITION TO DEMO / NEXT STEPS (2-3 minutes)
=============================================
"Thanks for sharing all of that. Based on what you've told me, I think
[specific capabilities] would be most relevant. I'd love to show you
[2-3 specific things]. Does that sound useful?"

If scheduling demo for later:
[ ] Confirm attendees for next call
[ ] Confirm date/time
[ ] Send calendar invite before hanging up
[ ] "What would make our next call a success for you?"

POST-CALL (Immediately after)
=============================
[ ] Log call notes in CRM
[ ] Update deal stage and close date
[ ] Note key pain points and decision criteria
[ ] Identify stakeholders mentioned
[ ] Send follow-up email within 2 hours
[ ] Prepare customized demo based on discoveries

FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATE
========================
Subject: Great connecting - next steps for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Great talking with you today. A few things stood out:

• [Pain point 1 they mentioned]
• [Pain point 2 they mentioned]
• [Timeline or driver they mentioned]

As promised, I'd like to show you how VelocityRM addresses [specific need].

[If demo scheduled]: Looking forward to [date/time]. I'll send a calendar invite.

[If no next step yet]: Would you have 30 minutes this week for a quick demo
focused on [their specific pain]?

Best,
[Your name]

RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR
======================
🚩 Vague answers to pain questions (no real urgency)
🚩 Can't articulate decision process (may not be real opportunity)
🚩 Won't discuss budget or timeline (not qualified)
🚩 No access to economic buyer (deal will stall)
🚩 "Just looking" or "doing research" (early stage, may not be serious)

GOOD SIGNALS
============
✅ Specific, quantified pain ("We missed forecast by 30% last quarter")
✅ Clear timeline tied to business event
✅ Multiple stakeholders engaged
✅ Previous negative experience with current solution
✅ Asking detailed questions about implementation
