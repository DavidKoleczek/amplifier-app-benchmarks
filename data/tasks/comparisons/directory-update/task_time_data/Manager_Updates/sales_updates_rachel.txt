Subject: RE: Sales Team Directory Updates - Mike's Promotion!!

Hi Team,

Just following up AGAIN on Mike Thompson's promotion. This is effective January 1st and I submitted the paperwork back in December. His new title should be:

**Senior Sales Representative**

I've mentioned this in like 3 emails now and the directory still shows him as just "Sales Representative." Can we please get this updated? He's meeting with clients this week and it's embarrassing when they look him up and see the wrong title.

Also, small thing - Kevin Patel prefers to go by "Kev" but I know the directory uses legal names so that's probably fine to leave as is.

Lisa Wang is doing great but no changes for her.

Thanks!
Rachel

P.S. - Mike's promotion was also announced company-wide on Jan 3rd, so everyone already knows. Let's get the directory caught up!
