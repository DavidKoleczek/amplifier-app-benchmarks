Subject: Engineering Team Updates for Directory

Hi HR Team,

A few updates for the employee directory from Engineering:

1. DEPARTURE - Sarah Mitchell
   Her last day was January 10th. Please remove her from all systems. I've already collected her badge and laptop. IT is handling account deactivation.

2. NEW HIRE - Alex Nguyen
   Started January 6th as Software Engineer reporting to me. His extension is 3025 and he's seated on Floor 3, desk 3D.
   Email: alex.nguyen@techcorp.com
   
3. TEAM RESTRUCTURE
   With Sarah's departure, I'm restructuring the team a bit. James Wilson is now the technical lead for our backend systems, though his title stays the same for now. Emily Rodriguez is picking up some of Sarah's frontend work.

4. Ryan Taylor moved desks - he's now at 3F instead of 3E. Same extension though.

Let me know if you need any other info.

Thanks,
David
