Subject: RE: Wayne Marketing Services - Urgent Request

Michael,

I know we don't have the contract finalized yet, but I need to move forward with Wayne on some urgent Q1 planning work. Legal is still going back and forth on the IP clause and it's taking forever.

Can we get an exception to start some preliminary work? I'm thinking:
- 20 hours of brand strategy consultation (~$5,000)
- One market research report for Q1 planning ($3,500)

Total would be around $8,500. I have budget for this in my Q4 marketing allocation.

I take responsibility for this - if the contract falls through, we'll figure it out.

Sarah,

I understand the urgency, but you know this is against policy. We shouldn't be approving work without a signed agreement.

That said, given the amount is under $10k and you have budget authority, I can note this as a verbal approval in our records. BUT:

1. Get the contract signed ASAP - I mean it
2. Make sure Wayne understands they're proceeding at their own risk
3. Any invoice they send needs to clearly reference this email thread

Jennifer - any concerns from your end?

I'm not thrilled about this, but I'll allow it given:
- Amount is under $10k
- Sarah has budget authority
- We have a paper trail (this email)

Sarah - please push legal to close out that contract. This is a one-time exception.
