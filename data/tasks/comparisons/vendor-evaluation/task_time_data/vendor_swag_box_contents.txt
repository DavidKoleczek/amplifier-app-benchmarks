WHAT TO DO WITH THIS STUFF?

Options:
1. Keep in closet (current)
2. Put in break room (people will take)
3. Throw away (seems wasteful)
4. Give to whichever vendor we DON'T choose? (awkward)

Mike wants the Salesforce water bottle.
Lisa already took the HubSpot mug.

I guess we're keeping it.

NOTE: Swag quality has zero correlation with product 
quality. Don't let this influence anything.

Though the HubSpot socks are kind of funny.
