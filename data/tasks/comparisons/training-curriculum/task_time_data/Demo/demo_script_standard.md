## SECTION 1: OPENING & AGENDA (3 minutes)

### Talking Points

"Thanks for making time for this demo. Before I start clicking around, let me quickly recap what I'm hoping to show you today based on our last conversation."

"We'll focus on three things:
1. How VelocityRM gives you real-time visibility into pipeline health
2. Our AI-powered deal scoring - what we call VelocityScore
3. How our forecasting engine delivers 85%+ accuracy

Does that sound right? Anything else you want to make sure we cover?"

### Tips
- Let them add to the agenda
- If they mention something not planned, acknowledge and adjust
- Time-box: "We have about 40 minutes - I'll leave time for questions"

---

## SECTION 2: PAIN RECAP (5 minutes)

### Talking Points

"Before I dive in, I want to make sure I understood your challenges correctly from our last call..."

**Customize based on discovery. Use their words:**

For forecast accuracy pain:
> "You mentioned that your forecasts have been off by about 30%, and that's creating tension with the board. Is that still the biggest pain point?"

For pipeline visibility pain:
> "You said your managers can't tell which deals are healthy until it's too late. Still true?"

For tool frustration pain:
> "You mentioned reps are spending too much time on data entry instead of selling. Still the case?"

### Transition

"Great, let me show you how VelocityRM addresses that directly..."

---

## SECTION 3: PIPELINE VIEW (8 minutes)

### What to Show

1. **Dashboard Overview** (2 min)
   - Login to demo.velocityrm.io
   - Show the main dashboard
   - Highlight: Pipeline by stage, forecast summary, key metrics

2. **Pipeline Board** (3 min)
   - Switch to Kanban board view
   - Show drag-and-drop stage progression
   - Point out color-coded deal health indicators
   - "Notice how you can see at a glance which deals need attention"

3. **Deal List View** (3 min)
   - Switch to list view
   - Show filtering and sorting
   - Demonstrate quick filters: "My deals," "At risk," "Closing this month"
   - Show inline editing

### Key Talking Points

> "This is your pipeline at a glance. No more logging into three different systems or waiting for someone to compile a report."

> "See these color indicators? Green means healthy, yellow needs attention, red is at risk. Your reps and managers can focus their time where it matters."

> "Everything updates in real-time. When a rep logs an email or has a meeting, the activity shows up immediately."

### Common Questions

**Q: "How does data get into the system?"**
A: "Three ways: automatic sync from email and calendar, integrations with tools like Slack and Zoom, and manual entry when needed. Most customers find 80%+ of activity is captured automatically."

**Q: "Can we customize the stages?"**
A: "Absolutely. You define your sales process, and VelocityRM adapts. Most customers are up and running with their own stages in day one."

## SECTION 4: DEAL INTELLIGENCE / VELOCITYSCORE (10 minutes)

**This is our key differentiator. Spend time here.**

### What to Show

1. **Open a specific deal** (2 min)
   - Click into "Acme Corp - Enterprise Expansion"
   - Show the deal summary page
   - Point out the VelocityScore prominently displayed

2. **Explain VelocityScore** (3 min)
   - Show the score breakdown (Engagement, Momentum, Fit, Timing)
   - Click into each category to show contributing factors
   - "This isn't a guess - it's based on 47 different signals"

3. **Activity Timeline** (2 min)
   - Scroll to activity timeline
   - Show automatically captured emails and meetings
   - Point out sentiment indicators on communications

4. **Recommended Actions** (3 min)
   - Show the "Recommended Next Steps" section
   - "The system analyzes similar won deals and suggests what to do next"
   - "For this deal, it's recommending we get the CFO involved - because deals this size without finance engagement have 40% lower close rates"

### Key Talking Points

> "VelocityScore is what sets us apart. It's not just a weighted probability based on stage - it's actual AI analyzing 47 signals across engagement, momentum, fit, and timing."

> "See this score of 72? That means based on everything we know about this deal - the email response times, meeting frequency, stakeholder involvement, how it compares to deals we've seen before - there's a 72% likelihood of closing."

> "But here's the key - it's not a black box. You can see exactly WHY it's scoring this way. The momentum score is low because activity dropped off last week. That's actionable intelligence."

> "Our customers typically see 20-30% improvement in forecast accuracy just from VelocityScore alone."

### Demo the "At Risk" View

- Navigate to "At Risk Deals" filter
- Show how managers can quickly see which deals need attention
- "Every morning, your sales managers can check this view in 30 seconds and know exactly where to focus."

### Common Questions

**Q: "How accurate is the scoring?"**
A: "Our customers report 85%+ forecast accuracy using VelocityScore, compared to 60-70% with traditional methods. We've trained the model on over 2 million deals."

**Q: "Can we customize the scoring model?"**
A: "On Enterprise tier, yes. But most customers find the standard model works extremely well out of the box. We recommend using it for a quarter before customizing."

**Q: "What if reps don't log activities?"**
A: "That's the beauty - most activity is captured automatically from email and calendar. Reps don't have to log anything manually for the basic scoring to work."

## SECTION 5: FORECASTING (8 minutes)

### What to Show

1. **Forecast Dashboard** (3 min)
   - Navigate to Forecasting section
   - Show the forecast summary: Commit, Best Case, Pipeline
   - Point out the AI adjustment vs. raw rollup
   - "Notice the AI adjustment here - the raw rollup said $2.4M, but the AI model adjusted to $2.1M based on historical patterns. Last quarter, the AI was right."

2. **Forecast Drill-Down** (3 min)
   - Click into a forecast category
   - Show the deals comprising it
   - Show deal-level overrides and justifications
   - "Managers can override the AI prediction, but they have to explain why. Creates accountability."

3. **Forecast History** (2 min)
   - Show forecast accuracy tracking over time
   - "You can see how accurate your forecasts have been - and which reps consistently over or under-forecast"

### Key Talking Points

> "This is where VelocityRM really shines. Our forecasting isn't just rolling up what reps put in their pipeline - it's applying AI to predict what will actually close."

> "See this confidence interval? We're saying there's an 80% chance you'll close between $1.9M and $2.3M this quarter. That's real predictability you can take to the board."

> "The system learns from your data. The more you use it, the more accurate it gets for your specific business."

### Common Questions

**Q: "How long before the forecasting is accurate?"**
A: "You'll see value immediately because we've trained on millions of deals. But after one quarter with your data, accuracy improves significantly. By quarter two, most customers hit 85%+."

**Q: "Can managers still adjust forecasts?"**
A: "Absolutely. We believe in AI-augmented, not AI-replaced decision making. Managers can override any deal or the overall forecast, but we track those overrides so you can see who's accurate."

## SECTION 6: WRAP-UP (5 minutes)

### Talking Points

"That's the core of VelocityRM. Before we wrap up..."

"Based on what you've seen, how well do you think this addresses [their specific pain from discovery]?"

"What questions do you have?"

"What would need to be true for this to be the right solution for you?"

### Next Steps

Always end with a clear next step:

- If ready: "Let's schedule a call to discuss pricing and implementation timeline. Who else should be on that call?"

- If needs more evaluation: "Would it be helpful to get you into a trial environment with your own data? We can have that set up in 48 hours."

- If needs more stakeholders: "It sounds like [person] should see this too. Can we schedule a follow-up demo with them?"

### Closing

"Thanks for your time today. I'll send a follow-up email with [specific materials they requested]. What's the best way to stay in touch?"
