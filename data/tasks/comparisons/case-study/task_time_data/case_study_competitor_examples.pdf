KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR HEALTHFIRST CASE STUDY
================================================================================

BEST PRACTICES TO ADOPT:
1. Lead with a strong executive quote
2. Include specific, quantified results (ROI, time savings)
3. Use real customer photography when possible
4. Include clear before/after comparison
5. Keep primary document concise (4-6 pages max)
6. Highlight healthcare-specific elements (compliance, EHR integration)

DIFFERENTIATION OPPORTUNITIES:
1. Include honest discussion of implementation challenges
   - None of the competitors do this
   - HealthFirst has approved this approach
   - Will feel more authentic and credible

2. Feature clinical perspective (Dr. Torres)
   - Most case studies only have IT/admin voices
   - Clinician testimonial is powerful

3. Show the recovery story
   - "How we handled problems" is unique
   - Demonstrates partnership, not just product

4. Multi-media approach
   - Written case study
   - Video testimonial (in planning)
   - Presentation-ready slides
   - Social-friendly excerpts
