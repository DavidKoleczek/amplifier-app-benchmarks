Subject: RE: Q4 Board Deck - Financial Narrative

Maya,

Here's my summary of the financial story for the board deck. A few key points to frame:

**The Good News:**
- We beat revenue target: $2.15M vs $2.0M plan (107%)
- ARR hit $8.6M - this is a major milestone and ahead of schedule
- Gross margin improved to 82% (up from 81% in Q3)
- New business was strong: $680K in new logos

**The Challenging News (and how to frame it):**
- We lost GlobalMfg ($65K ARR) and Acme Logistics ($30K ARR)
- Total churn impact: $145K for the quarter vs $85K in Q3
- NRR dropped to 108% from 112%

My recommendation on framing the churn:
"Strategic customer portfolio optimization" - both accounts were:
1. Unprofitable (heavy support burden, custom work)
2. Poor fit for our ICP (too small, wrong vertical)
3. Distracting sales team from enterprise focus

The truth is we probably should have churned them earlier. Neither was going to expand, and we were spending disproportionate CS resources on them.

**Series B Framing:**
- We CANNOT present this as done. Robert was very clear.
- Say: "Active discussions with 3 top-tier firms"
- Say: "Targeting $15-20M raise at $60-80M valuation range"
- Do NOT name the firms (Greylock, Accel, Index) in the deck
- Do NOT include term sheet details

**Cash Position - The Elephant in the Room:**
- $1.91M ending cash
- 4.4 months runway at current burn
- This is FINE if Series B closes by March (expected)
- This is CRITICAL if Series B delays
- Board will ask about contingency - have answer ready

Contingency options if Series B delays:
1. Cut burn 30% (painful but survivable) - buys 2 more months
2. Bridge financing from existing investors - likely available
3. Accelerate enterprise pipeline closure - some deals can pull in

**Metrics Board Will Focus On:**
- NRR decline (have the churn narrative ready)
- Cash runway (have contingency ready)
- Enterprise mix improvement (good story here: 55% now)

Let me know if you want to rehearse the financial Q&A before the meeting.

Marcus

P.S. - Make sure to use v3 of the financials spreadsheet. v1 had the old October projections which were way off. December actuals came in much stronger.
