===================================
January 2026 | Confidential - Internal Sales Use Only
Prepared by: Competitive Intelligence Team

================================================================================
COMPETITOR #1: SALESFORCE SALES CLOUD
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
- Market leader with 20%+ CRM market share
- Part of broader Salesforce ecosystem
- Typical pricing: $150-300/user/month (Enterprise editions)
- Strength: Ecosystem, brand recognition, breadth of features

WHEN WE WIN
-----------
✓ Speed of deployment (weeks vs. months)
✓ AI-native forecasting (our core strength)
✓ Lower TCO (40-60% less than comparable Salesforce setup)
✓ Easier administration (no dedicated admin required)
✓ Modern, intuitive UX

WHEN WE LOSE
------------
✗ Customer already invested heavily in Salesforce ecosystem
✗ Need for highly custom workflows (Salesforce's AppExchange)
✗ Risk aversion ("nobody gets fired for buying Salesforce")
✗ Global enterprise with complex multi-org requirements

KEY BATTLEGROUND: FORECASTING
-----------------------------
SALESFORCE: Einstein Forecasting available but requires additional license.
Manual forecasting is painful. Reports are complex to build.

VELOCITYRM: AI forecasting included in Professional+. 85% accuracy vs.
Salesforce's typical 60-70%. Forecasts update automatically, not quarterly.

TALK TRACK:
"Salesforce pioneered CRM, and we respect that. But their forecasting was
bolted on years after the core product. VelocityRM was built AI-first for
forecasting. Our customers consistently achieve 85%+ forecast accuracy -
that's 20-30 points higher than what we see with Salesforce. Would 20% better
forecast accuracy change how you run your business?"

LANDMINES TO SET (questions to plant):
- "Ask Salesforce how many customers achieve >80% forecast accuracy."
- "Ask about total cost including implementation, admin, and add-ons."
- "Ask about their average time-to-value for new customers."

OBJECTION: "We're already on Salesforce"
RESPONSE: "Many of our customers came from Salesforce. They weren't unhappy
with Salesforce overall, but they needed better forecasting and pipeline
intelligence. Some kept Salesforce for other use cases and layered VelocityRM
on top. Would you be open to seeing how that works?"

================================================================================
COMPETITOR #2: HUBSPOT SALES HUB
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
- Strong in inbound/marketing-led sales motions
- Popular with SMB and growth-stage companies
- Typical pricing: $90-120/user/month (Professional/Enterprise)
- Strength: Ease of use, marketing integration, freemium funnel

WHEN WE WIN
-----------
✓ Complex B2B deal cycles (HubSpot built for transactional)
✓ Advanced forecasting needs
✓ Deal intelligence and scoring
✓ Enterprise security requirements
✓ Sophisticated reporting and analytics

WHEN WE LOSE
------------
✗ Marketing and sales tightly integrated (HubSpot's strength)
✗ SMB with simple sales process
✗ Already using HubSpot Marketing Hub
✗ Strong preference for all-in-one platform

KEY BATTLEGROUND: DEAL COMPLEXITY
---------------------------------
HUBSPOT: Designed for velocity sales. Works great when deals are small
and cycle times are short. Struggles with multi-threaded enterprise deals.

VELOCITYRM: Built for complex B2B. Stakeholder mapping, MEDDPICC tracking,
multi-quarter deal management, expansion revenue tracking.

TALK TRACK:
"HubSpot is fantastic for certain sales motions - especially inbound and
velocity deals. Where we see teams struggle with HubSpot is complex B2B sales
with multiple stakeholders and long deal cycles. VelocityRM was purpose-built
for that complexity. How would you describe your typical deal?"

LANDMINES TO SET:
- "Ask HubSpot how they handle multi-stakeholder deal tracking."
- "Ask about their forecast accuracy metrics."
- "Ask how they manage deals that span multiple quarters."

================================================================================
COMPETITOR #3: PIPEDRIVE
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
- Popular SMB CRM with visual pipeline
- Simple, affordable, easy to use
- Typical pricing: $50-100/user/month
- Strength: Simplicity, price, quick setup

WHEN WE WIN
-----------
✓ Teams scaling beyond SMB (Pipedrive doesn't scale)
✓ Need for AI and automation
✓ Enterprise requirements (security, compliance)
✓ Forecasting beyond basic weighted pipeline
✓ API and integration needs

WHEN WE LOSE
------------
✗ Very small teams (<10 reps) with simple needs
✗ Price-sensitive buyers who don't need advanced features
✗ Teams that value simplicity above all else

TALK TRACK:
"Pipedrive is great for small teams getting started. As you scale to [X] reps,
you'll likely find you need more - better forecasting, automation, reporting.
That's usually when teams come to us. Where do you see your team in 2 years?"

================================================================================
COMPETITOR #4: CLARI
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
- Revenue operations platform, not traditional CRM
- Strong in forecasting and pipeline analytics
- Typically used alongside Salesforce
- Typical pricing: $100-150/user/month

WHEN WE WIN
-----------
✓ Want single platform (Clari requires Salesforce)
✓ Full CRM needs (Clari is analytics layer only)
✓ Budget conscious (one tool vs. two)
✓ Mid-market (Clari targets enterprise)

WHEN WE LOSE
------------
✗ Already have Salesforce and just need analytics layer
✗ Conversation intelligence needs (Clari acquired Wingman)
✗ Very large enterprises with complex RevOps needs

KEY BATTLEGROUND: PLATFORM STRATEGY
-----------------------------------
CLARI: Analytics layer on top of your CRM. Still need Salesforce underneath.
Two vendors, two contracts, two support relationships.

VELOCITYRM: Complete platform with analytics built-in. One vendor, one source
of truth, lower total cost.

TALK TRACK:
"Clari makes a great product for analytics - but it sits on top of your CRM.
You still need Salesforce, which means two platforms, two contracts, and two
places where things can break. VelocityRM gives you everything in one place.
For most customers, that's simpler and more cost-effective."

================================================================================
COMPETITOR #5: FRESHSALES
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
- Part of Freshworks suite
- Budget-friendly option
- Typical pricing: $30-70/user/month
- Strength: Price, bundled with other Freshworks products

WHEN WE WIN
-----------
✓ Any serious B2B sales organization
✓ Need for AI/ML capabilities
✓ Integration requirements
✓ Reporting and analytics depth
✓ Enterprise features

WHEN WE LOSE
------------
✗ Extreme price sensitivity
✗ Already using Freshworks ecosystem
✗ Very basic CRM needs

TALK TRACK:
"Freshsales is affordable, no question. For basic contact and deal tracking,
it works. Where we see teams hit walls is when they need real forecasting,
automation, and analytics. Those capabilities simply aren't there. What
would missing a forecast by 20% cost your business?"

================================================================================

GENERAL COMPETITIVE TACTICS
================================================================================

1. DISCOVERY FIRST
Don't lead with competitive comparisons. Understand their needs, then position
against what matters to them.

2. NEVER BADMOUTH
"They're a good company, but here's where we're different..."
Negativity reflects poorly on you.

3. USE SOCIAL PROOF
"We've won a lot of deals against [competitor]. Here's what customers tell us
made the difference..."

4. KNOW THE OBJECTIONS
Every competitor has a common defense. Know them and have responses ready.

5. DEMO TO YOUR STRENGTHS
When competing, structure your demo around capabilities where you win.

6. LANDMINES WORK
Plant questions they should ask the competitor that expose weaknesses.
