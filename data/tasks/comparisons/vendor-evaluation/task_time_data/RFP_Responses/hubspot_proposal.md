## For Meridian Industries

**Prepared by:** HubSpot Mid-Market Team  
**Date:** November 18, 2025  
**Proposal #:** HB-2025-4892

---

## Why HubSpot?

HubSpot isn't just a CRM - it's a complete customer platform built from the ground up to help growing companies scale efficiently. Unlike legacy CRMs that bolt on features, HubSpot was designed as a unified system where marketing, sales, and service work together seamlessly.

**Our Promise:** You'll be up and running faster, your teams will actually use it, and you'll see value in weeks, not months.

## HubSpot vs. Alternatives

| Capability | HubSpot | Legacy Enterprise CRM | Lightweight CRM |
|------------|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Time to Value | Weeks | Months | Days |
| Ease of Use | Very High | Medium | High |
| Marketing Built-in | Yes | Add-on | No |

## Potential Limitations to Consider

We believe in transparency:

1. **Advanced Customization:** HubSpot is highly configurable but not infinitely customizable like Salesforce. Complex custom objects and relationships have some limits.

2. **Enterprise Reporting:** While reporting is strong, very complex multi-object reporting may require Operations Hub Professional or Enterprise.

3. **Offline Access:** Limited offline capabilities compared to some competitors.

4. **Security Certifications:** We're SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certified but do not have HIPAA BAA or FedRAMP at this time.
