Subject: Farewell to Sarah Mitchell

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share that today is Sarah Mitchell's last day at TechCorp.

Sarah has been a key member of the Engineering team for over 5 years, and her contributions have been invaluable. From leading our frontend architecture redesign to mentoring junior developers, she's left a lasting mark on our products and our team.

Sarah is moving on to pursue an exciting opportunity at a startup in the healthcare tech space - something she's been passionate about for a while. While we're sad to see her go, we're excited for her next chapter.

Please join me in thanking Sarah for her dedication and wishing her all the best in her new adventure!

If you'd like to sign the card or contribute to the group gift, see Stephanie in HR by 3pm today.

We'll be gathering in the 3rd floor kitchen at 3:30pm for cake and to wish Sarah well.

Thank you, Sarah - you'll be missed!

David
