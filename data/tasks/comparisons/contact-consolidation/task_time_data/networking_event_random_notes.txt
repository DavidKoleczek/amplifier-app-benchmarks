NETWORKING EVENT NOTES - TechConnect Mixer Dec 2025
===================================================

Random notes from the networking event. Most of these are quick impressions,
not actual contacts to add.

---

Guy with the red tie - talked about blockchain for 20 minutes. Avoid.

Woman from that startup... something about dog food delivery? 
Didn't get her card. Didn't want it.

The catering was excellent! Ask venue about their caterer for our next event.
- mini quiches were a hit
- avoid the shrimp (cold by the time it reached our table)

DJ was too loud - couldn't hear conversations after 8pm

That investor who kept talking about "synergy" - pretty sure he was just
trying to sell something. Didn't follow up.

Note to self: bring more business cards next time, ran out by 8:30

The open bar was a mistake - maybe switch to drink tickets next time

Met someone from a competitor but they were cagey about details. 
Didn't exchange info.

Parking garage closed at 11 - had to walk 3 blocks to car

Good turnout overall - maybe 150 people? Hard to tell.

Ran into Jake from college (not work related, just caught up)

Someone spilled wine on the raffle table - chaos ensued

Photo booth was a hit - see if we can get copies

Need to follow up with venue about deposit refund - they overcharged

The "speed networking" format was exhausting. Maybe do something 
different next time.

Weather was terrible - half the RSVPs probably no-showed due to rain

ACTUAL FOLLOW-UPS NEEDED:
1. Send thank you to venue manager (Sarah something?)
2. Get invoice finalized
3. Send survey to attendees
4. Book next quarter's event

None of these are contact additions - just event logistics!
