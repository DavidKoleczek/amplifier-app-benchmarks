  Create board meeting materials for our Q4 update:

  1. "Board_Deck_Q4.pptx" - A comprehensive board presentation covering:
     - Company update and key highlights
     - Financial performance summary
     - Department summaries from each team lead
     - Strategic outlook for 2026

  2. "Financial_Summary_Q4.xlsx" - Key financial metrics in spreadsheet format

  Important notes:
  - Series B discussions are ongoing but NOT finalized - don't present it as a done deal
  - We lost 2 enterprise customers this quarter - frame this as strategic refocusing, not a failure

  All source materials are in this folder. Some files have multiple versions - use the latest/most accurate.
