CFO FEEDBACK ON 2025 ENGINEERING BUDGET REQUEST
================================================
From: Patricia Chen, CFO
To: David Kim, Tech Lead; Michael Torres, VP Engineering
Date: January 25, 2025
Re: FY2025 Budget Request - Engineering

David, Michael,

Thank you for the detailed budget request. I've reviewed it with the executive 
team and wanted to provide context on our decisions.

APPROVED ITEMS
--------------
- Senior Engineer (L4): Approved. Clear need for technical leadership.
- QA Engineer (L3): Approved. Quality issues are impacting customer satisfaction.
- Infrastructure increase: Approved in full. Business growth requires this.
- Core tool renewals: Approved. Necessary for operations.

DENIED/REDUCED ITEMS
--------------------

1. Engineer II and DevOps Engineer positions (DENIED)
   
   I understand the utilization data shows the team is stretched. However, 
   given the company's cash position and upcoming Series B timeline, we need 
   to be conservative with headcount additions. We're asking all departments 
   to do more with less until we close the round.
   
   Suggestion: Revisit in Q3 if Series B closes successfully.

2. APM Tool - New Relic ($36,000) (DENIED)
   
   We already pay for Datadog. I'd like to see the team maximize the current 
   tooling before adding another vendor. Can you work with Datadog support 
   to enable the features you need?

3. Training & Conferences (REDUCED from $15K to $8K)
   
   Travel budgets are being reduced company-wide. Please prioritize virtual 
   options where possible.

LOOKING AHEAD
-------------
I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for. The engineering team has 
been doing great work, and I recognize the strain. My commitment:

- If we close Series B in H1, I will prioritize backfilling denied positions
- Q3 budget review will reconsider deferred requests
- Open to mid-year adjustments if critical needs arise

Please let me know if you want to discuss further. I'm happy to walk through 
the reasoning in more detail.

Best,
Patricia

FOLLOW-UP NOTE (Added October 2025)
-----------------------------------
Series B closed in August 2025. Q3 budget review was delayed due to 
integration planning. Engineering headcount requests deferred to 2026 cycle.

Turnover in 2025: 4 engineers (including Jennifer Walsh who was hired in Q1)
Current headcount: 8 (net decrease of 2 from start of year despite 2 hires)

This context should inform the 2026 budget discussion.
