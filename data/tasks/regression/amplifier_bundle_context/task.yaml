  You should have context from the smoke-test-bundle loaded into your system context. Your task is to find two specific verification tokens that prove bundle context resolution is working correctly.

  1. Look in your system context for a verification token that starts with 'BUNDLE_'. This token proves direct context.include resolution works (context included directly in the bundle's frontmatter).

  2. Look in your system context for a verification token that starts with 'BEHAVIOR_'. This token proves transitive context resolution works (context contributed by an included behavior).

  Report BOTH exact tokens you found. If you cannot find one or both tokens, say which ones are missing.
