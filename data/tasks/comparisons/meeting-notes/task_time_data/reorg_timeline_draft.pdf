Date: January 10, 2026
Status: DRAFT - For Leadership Review Only

================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the proposed consolidation of the Platform Team and 
Infrastructure Team into a single unified Engineering Platform group. The goal
is to eliminate duplication, improve efficiency, and reduce costs by 15-20%.

================================================================================

BACKGROUND

Current State:
- Platform Team: 8 FTEs (reports to Marcus Williams)
- Infrastructure Team: 6 FTEs (reports to separate manager)
- Total headcount: 14 FTEs

Issues Identified:
1. Overlapping responsibilities in deployment/DevOps
2. Duplicate tooling and processes
3. Communication gaps between teams
4. Unclear ownership of shared services
5. Budget pressure requiring efficiency gains

================================================================================

PROPOSED STRUCTURE

New "Engineering Platform" Team:
- Combined headcount: 12-14 FTEs (TBD based on role alignment)
- Single reporting line
- Clear ownership of all platform and infrastructure functions

Leadership Options (under consideration):
Option A: Promote internal candidate from Platform Team
Option B: Promote internal candidate from Infrastructure Team  
Option C: External hire (not preferred given timeline)

Decision deadline: January 22, 2026
