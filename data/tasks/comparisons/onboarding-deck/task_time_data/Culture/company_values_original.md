## Our Core Values

### Move Fast and Break Things

In a rapidly evolving market, speed is our competitive advantage. We ship early, iterate often, and don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Mistakes are learning opportunities.

### Relentless Growth

We are building something big. Every decision should be evaluated through the lens of: does this help us grow? Personal growth, team growth, company growth - it's all connected.

### Customer Obsession

Our customers are why we exist. We go above and beyond to delight them. No request is too small, no problem too complex. The customer is always our north star.

### Work Hard, Play Hard

We expect excellence and we reward it. When we hit milestones, we celebrate. We work intensely and we have fun doing it.

### One Team, One Dream

We win together and lose together. No silos, no politics, no finger-pointing. We're all rowing in the same direction toward the same goal.
