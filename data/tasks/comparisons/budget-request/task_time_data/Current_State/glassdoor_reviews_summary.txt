SELECTED QUOTES (ANONYMIZED)
----------------------------
"Love the work, but the team is stretched way too thin. We've lost 4 people 
this year and haven't backfilled. It's not sustainable."

"I used to recommend this place to friends. Now I tell them to wait until 
they hire more engineers. The burnout is real."

"Great company with a serious understaffing problem. My manager is supportive 
but there's only so much they can do when we need 3 more people."

"The product roadmap is ambitious but the team can't deliver without more 
hands. Something has to give - either scope or headcount."

"Overtime is the norm, not the exception. Weekend deployments happen 
because we don't have enough people to cover normal hours."

MANAGEMENT RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------------------------
1. Address staffing concerns in next budget cycle
2. Consider retention bonuses for high-risk employees
3. Review on-call rotation and compensation
4. Communicate hiring plans to team
