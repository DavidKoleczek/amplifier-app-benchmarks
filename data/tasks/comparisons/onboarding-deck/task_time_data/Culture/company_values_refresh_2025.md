## Why We Refreshed Our Values

In early 2025, we conducted a company-wide values survey and held listening sessions across all departments. The feedback was clear: our original values from 2019 felt corporate and disconnected from how we actually work together.

The Q3 restructuring also prompted reflection on what truly matters to us as a company. We emerged with five values that reflect who we are today.

## Our Values

### 1. People First, Always

We take care of each other. That means honest feedback, genuine support during tough times, and celebrating wins together. We hire adults and treat them like adults.

**What this looks like:**
- Managers check in on wellbeing, not just deliverables
- We're flexible when life happens
- We give feedback directly and kindly
- We don't sacrifice people for short-term results

### 2. Own Your Work

We hire talented people and get out of their way. Everyone is empowered to make decisions in their domain. With ownership comes accountability - we deliver what we commit to.

**What this looks like:**
- Decisions are made by those closest to the work
- We don't play blame games when things go wrong
- We volunteer for hard problems
- We see projects through to completion

### 3. Stay Curious

The best solutions come from people who keep learning. We ask questions, challenge assumptions, and admit when we don't know something.

**What this looks like:**
- We say "I don't know, let me find out"
- Learning time is protected, not squeezed out
- We welcome diverse perspectives
- We experiment and learn from failures

### 4. Communicate Openly

We default to transparency. Good news, bad news, hard questions - we share them. Information hoarding creates silos and slows us down.

**What this looks like:**
- Leadership shares context, not just decisions
- We document and share knowledge
- We raise concerns early, not after they become crises
- We listen more than we talk

### 5. Build Sustainably

We're in this for the long haul. That means making decisions we'll be proud of in 5 years, not just this quarter. It means protecting our health, our relationships, and our planet.

**What this looks like:**
- We work sustainable hours (emergencies are exceptions, not norms)
- We invest in infrastructure and maintenance, not just features
- We consider environmental impact
- We plan for multiple scenarios, not just best-case

## Values We Retired

Our original 2019 values included:

- ~~"Move Fast and Break Things"~~ → Replaced with "Build Sustainably" - speed matters but not at the cost of quality or people
- ~~"Relentless Growth"~~ → Retired completely - growth is one metric among many
- ~~"Work Hard, Play Hard"~~ → Retired - this often became "work hard, then work harder"
- ~~"Customer Obsession"~~ → Retained in spirit but balanced with employee wellbeing

## Living Our Values

Values only matter if they influence decisions. We're integrating these values into:

- Performance reviews (40% of evaluation based on values alignment)
- Hiring process (values-based interview stage added)
- Leadership decisions (referenced explicitly in major communications)
- Recognition programs (monthly values awards)
