## Q2 2025 Notes (Implementation Phase)

**Date:** June 30, 2025

### Relationship Status: Yellow (At Risk)

Implementation is running 5 weeks behind schedule. Customer executive sponsor (Michael Chen, CIO) remains supportive but is under pressure from clinical leadership. Key concerns:

- Emergency Department Chief (Dr. Torres) has been vocal about her concerns
- CFO asking questions about timeline delays
- Board meeting next month will include deployment update

### Actions Taken:
- Weekly executive check-ins established
- Jennifer Martinez (VP PS) assigned as executive sponsor on our side
- Extended hypercare approved proactively

### Sentiment Tracking:
- CIO Michael Chen: Supportive but cautious
- CMO Dr. Williams: Neutral, watching clinical adoption
- CFO Sandra Miller: Concerned about delays
- ED Chief Dr. Torres: Frustrated, needs reassurance

### Renewal Risk Assessment: Low-Medium
Despite delays, no indication of buyer's remorse. Customer understands root causes and appreciates transparency.
