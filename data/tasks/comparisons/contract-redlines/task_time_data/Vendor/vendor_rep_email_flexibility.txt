Subject: RE: Contract Discussion - Quick Sync

Jennifer,

Thanks for the call earlier. As promised, here's a summary of where we have flexibility on the contract terms. I've had preliminary conversations with our legal team and leadership.

AREAS WHERE WE CAN BE FLEXIBLE:

1. Payment Terms
   - We can move from Net 30 to Net 45. Our CFO approved this given your size and payment history with other vendors.

2. Termination Notice Period
   - We can accept asymmetric termination rights (30 days for you, 90 for us). We'd rather keep you happy than hold you to a contract you don't want.

3. Insurance Limits
   - We're already working with our broker on increased coverage. We can likely get to:
     * CGL: $2M (up from $1M) - no problem
     * E&O: $4M (up from $2M) - broker says yes
     * Cyber: $7M (up from $3M) - this is the max our carrier will do at reasonable cost
   - If you need higher cyber limits, we'd need to discuss cost sharing or a different carrier.

4. Breach Notification
   - 24 hours is tight but doable. Our security team confirmed we can meet this SLA.

5. Audit Rights
   - We're fine with customer audit rights with reasonable notice (we typically ask for 2 weeks minimum).

AREAS WHERE WE'LL NEED TO DISCUSS FURTHER:

1. Liability Cap
   - Our standard is 1x annual fees. I understand you're looking for higher.
   - I got preliminary approval for up to 2x for Tier 1 customers like Acme.
   - Going to 3x would require executive sign-off. Possible but will add time to the process.
   - Can we discuss what specific scenarios are driving the higher cap requirement? That might help me make the case internally.

2. Indemnification Scope
   - The standard mutual indemnification is what we sign with 90% of customers.
   - I need to better understand the concern around Customer Data indemnification.
   - Our legal counsel, Sarah Chen, would like to have a direct conversation with your legal team to work through this.

3. IP/Data Usage Restrictions
   - This is new language we haven't seen before. I'll be honest - our product team is planning ML-based features and they may have concerns.
   - Can we schedule a call to understand exactly what you're trying to protect against? There may be a middle ground.

AREAS WHERE WE'RE FIRM:

1. Base Pricing
   - The $40K/month we agreed to is already at our floor for this deal size. No room here.

2. Implementation Timeline
   - 4 months is aggressive. We can't compress further without risking quality.

NEXT STEPS:

I think the cleanest path is:
1. You send us your redlined contract
2. Sarah and your legal counsel have a 30-minute call to align on the trickier issues
3. We turn around a response within 5 business days
4. One more negotiation call to close remaining gaps

I'm committed to getting this done before your Feb 15 deadline. Let me know what works on your end.

Best,
Marcus
