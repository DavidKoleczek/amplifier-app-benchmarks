======================================================

OLD PRICING REFERENCES (INVALID):
- Basic: $35/user/month ← NOW STARTER @ $45
- Professional: $65/user/month ← NOW $85
- Enterprise: $120/user/month ← NOW $150+

OLD QUALIFICATION FRAMEWORK (BANT):
We have migrated from BANT to MEDDPICC. While BANT is still
useful for initial qualification, MEDDPICC provides deeper
deal qualification. See v2.0 playbook for new framework.

OLD COMPETITIVE POSITIONING:
Some competitive responses referenced outdated competitor
features. See competitive_battlecards.pdf for current intel.

3. Sales Team Feedback
