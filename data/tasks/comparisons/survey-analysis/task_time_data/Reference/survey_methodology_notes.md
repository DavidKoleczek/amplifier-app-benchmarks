# Survey Methodology Notes

## Survey Administration

### Timeline
- **Survey Open:** January 6, 2025
- **Reminder 1:** January 10, 2025

- **Survey Close:** January 20, 2025

### Distribution

## Response Handling

### Anonymity Protections
- No individual responses shared with managers
- Departments with fewer than 5 respondents are aggregated to "Other" in reports
- Free-text responses are reviewed by HR before sharing with leadership
- Names and identifying details must be redacted from qualitative summaries

### Data Quality
- Responses with all identical scores flagged for review (straight-lining)
- Incomplete responses (< 50% questions answered) excluded
- Average completion time: 8.5 minutes

## Scoring Methodology

### Quantitative Questions
- 5-point Likert scale: 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree)
- Category scores = simple average of questions in that category
- Department scores = average of all respondents in that department

### Favorability Calculation
- **Favorable:** Score of 4 or 5
- **Neutral:** Score of 3
- **Unfavorable:** Score of 1 or 2

## Year-over-Year Comparison Notes

### 2025 vs 2024 Changes
- Q5 (compensation) was reworded for clarity - direct comparison may be impacted
- Leadership category added Q9 (trust) - new for 2025
- Wellbeing category was "Work Environment" in 2024 - questions unchanged

### Department Changes
- "DevOps" merged into "Engineering" in 2025
- "Customer Success" renamed to "Customer Support"

## Known Limitations
1. Self-selection bias: most engaged employees may over-respond
2. Timing: January surveys may capture holiday stress
3. Remote workers: historically lower response rates
4. Small departments: Legal (8 people) may not be representative
