Team, I just got off a call with the steering committee. They're asking why we're not on track for the September 15th milestone that was in the v2 plan.

Alex Turner [2025-09-08 09:05 AM]
The September 15th date was set before the workflow automation scope change. That alone added 6 weeks of work.

Sarah Kim [2025-09-08 09:08 AM]
And the custom fields feature. And the SSO requirement. We've absorbed like 5 major scope changes since that plan was made.

David Park [2025-09-08 09:12 AM]
I have the scope change log. 23 changes total since March. Want me to share the impact breakdown?

James Chen [2025-09-08 09:15 AM]
Please do. I need ammunition for the exec meeting.

Not to pile on, but we also lost a week in August when the security vulnerability was found. All hands on deck for that.

Maria Santos [2025-09-08 09:23 AM]
That was necessary. We couldn't ship with that vulnerability.

Jennifer Liu [2025-09-08 09:25 AM]
Totally agree! Not blaming anyone. Just pointing out it was unplanned work.

Michael Brown [2025-09-08 09:30 AM]
I think the root issue is that every time we say "yes" to a scope change, we're not adjusting the timeline. It's like we expect the extra work to just... fit.

Alex Turner [2025-09-08 09:35 AM]
THIS. We keep absorbing scope without pushing dates. Then everyone acts surprised when we're behind.

James Chen [2025-09-08 09:40 AM]
I hear you. The pressure from the client side is real though. They're paying for these features.

David Park [2025-09-08 09:45 AM]
Can we have an honest conversation about what "on track" even means at this point? The original plan had us launching in September. We're clearly not launching in September.

Just finished the exec call. I shared the scope change impact analysis. 

Outcome: They're acknowledging the timeline slip was driven by scope, not execution. New target is end of November.

Sarah Kim [2025-09-08 02:05 PM]
That's a relief. I was worried this was going to turn into a blame game.

Alex Turner [2025-09-08 02:08 PM]
Is the scope now frozen? Or are we going to keep adding things?

James Chen [2025-09-08 02:12 PM]
I pushed hard for a scope freeze. Leadership agreed - no new features after September 15th. Bug fixes and polish only.

Maria Santos [2025-09-08 02:15 PM]
Can we get that in writing? Seriously. I've seen "scope freezes" melt before.

James Chen [2025-09-08 02:18 PM]
Fair point. I'll get it documented and sent to the client for acknowledgment.

New scope change request just came in from TechCorp. They want data retention policies.

Alex Turner [2025-09-09 10:03 AM]
You have got to be kidding me.

Sarah Kim [2025-09-09 10:05 AM]
@James Chen I thought we had a scope freeze?

James Chen [2025-09-09 10:10 AM]
Let me look at this. Might be compliance-related which could be a blocker for them.

David Park [2025-09-09 10:15 AM]
If it's truly compliance-required, we might not have a choice. But can we at least push it to a fast-follow release?

James Chen [2025-09-09 10:30 AM]
Talked to the client. It IS compliance-related - they can't go live without data retention. But they agreed it's a small scope - just the policy framework, not the full implementation.

We're estimating 2 weeks of work. I know this sucks but it's the last one.

Alex Turner [2025-09-09 10:35 AM]
"The last one." I'll believe it when I see it.

Maria Santos [2025-09-09 10:38 AM]
At least compliance requirements are legitimate blockers. Unlike "nice to have" features.

Jennifer Liu [2025-09-10 09:00 AM]
Hey team, just want to say - I know this has been frustrating. But we're still building good software. The client is actually really happy with what they're seeing in demos.

Michael Brown [2025-09-10 09:05 AM]
Thanks Jennifer. Sometimes it helps to step back and remember the big picture.

David Park [2025-09-10 09:10 AM]
Agreed. We're stressed about timeline, but the product is solid. That matters.

James Chen [2025-09-10 09:15 AM]
Good perspective. Let's finish strong. The finish line is in sight.

Sarah Kim [2025-09-10 09:18 AM]
November it is. Let's do this.
