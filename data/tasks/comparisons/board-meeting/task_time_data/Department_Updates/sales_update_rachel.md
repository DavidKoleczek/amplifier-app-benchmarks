## Executive Summary

Q4 was a mixed quarter. We exceeded our new business target but lost two enterprise customers, impacting our net growth. Pipeline remains strong but sales cycles are lengthening as enterprise buyers become more cautious.

## New Customers Closed (Q4)

| Customer | ACV | Segment | Notes |
|----------|-----|---------|-------|
| HealthFirst Systems | $185,000 | Enterprise | Healthcare vertical win |
| Pacific Manufacturing | $142,000 | Enterprise | Competitive displacement |
| Midwest Distribution | $95,000 | Business | Expansion potential |
| TechFlow Inc | $88,000 | Business | Fast sales cycle (32 days) |

**Total New Business: $680,000**

## Churned Customers

### GlobalMfg Industries ($65,000 ARR)
- **Lost to:** SAP (existing vendor consolidated)
- **Reason:** New CFO mandated ERP consolidation
- **Lesson:** We need better C-suite relationships, not just ops buyers

### Acme Logistics ($30,000 ARR)  
- **Lost to:** Competitor (Kinaxis)
- **Reason:** Feature gap in supplier risk management
- **Lesson:** Accelerate supplier risk module roadmap

### Other Churn ($50,000 ARR)
- 4 Essentials customers churned (strategic - low fit)
- Non-renewals from customers who never fully implemented

**My honest assessment:** The GlobalMfg loss hurts. But they were always going to consolidate on SAP - we were a point solution fighting an enterprise mandate. Acme is more concerning because we lost on product. The supplier risk module can't come soon enough.

## Pipeline Analysis

### Current Pipeline: $4.8M

| Stage | Amount | # Deals | Avg Size |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| Discovery | $1.2M | 18 | $67K |
| Evaluation | $1.8M | 14 | $129K |
| Negotiation | $1.2M | 8 | $150K |
| Contract | $0.6M | 4 | $150K |

### Coverage Ratio: 2.8x
- Target: 3.0x
- Slightly below target but improving

### Pipeline Health Concerns

1. **Enterprise deals taking longer**
   - Q3 avg cycle: 68 days
   - Q4 avg cycle: 78 days
   - Buyers are more cautious, more stakeholders involved

2. **Q1 pipeline concentration**
   - Top 3 deals = 40% of pipeline
   - Need more mid-sized deals in funnel

3. **Competitor activity**
   - Kinaxis aggressive on pricing in 3 recent deals
   - SAP offering "AI add-on" positioning

## Win/Loss Analysis

### Win Rate by Segment
| Segment | Q3 | Q4 | Trend |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| Enterprise | 28% | 32% | ↑ |
| Business | 38% | 35% | ↓ |
| Overall | 34% | 33% | → |

### Why We Win
1. Speed to value (12-week implementation vs 12-month for SAP)
2. AI accuracy / forecasting quality
3. Modern UX / ease of use
4. Pricing (60-70% below enterprise alternatives)

### Why We Lose
1. Missing features (supplier risk #1 gap)
2. Perceived company stability ("are you funded?")
3. Enterprise IT requirements we can't meet
4. Existing vendor relationships

|------|-----|-----------|
| Account Executives | 6 | 8 |

---

## What I Need from the Board

1. **Confidence signal on Series B** - Prospects are asking about our funding. "Active discussions" isn't cutting it anymore.

2. **Product roadmap clarity** - When is supplier risk module? This is costing us deals.

3. **International expansion timeline** - UK pipeline is building but we can't close without EU data residency.
