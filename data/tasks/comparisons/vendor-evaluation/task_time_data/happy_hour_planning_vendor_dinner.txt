Okay so Marcus (Salesforce) invited the team to dinner after 
the final presentation. He's booking Gibson's Steakhouse.

Do we accept? Is this ethical? 

I've done vendor dinners before at other companies but want 
to make sure we're okay here.

Thoughts?

Checked with legal. We're fine as long as:
1. We don't let it influence decision (obviously)
2. Total value under $150/person (company policy)
3. We'd accept same from all vendors

Gibson's is probably over $150/head though...

Can we suggest somewhere more reasonable?

HubSpot team also mentioned grabbing drinks. Amanda said 
they usually do something casual.

Pipedrive didn't offer anything (smaller company I guess).

What if we just do our own team dinner to discuss the 
evaluation? Expense it ourselves? Avoids the awkwardness.

Good idea Jennifer. Let's do our own thing.

I'll tell Marcus thanks but we're keeping vendor 
relationships professional during evaluation. Maybe 
after we sign (if we go with them).

Same message to HubSpot.

How about that new Italian place on Clark? Thursday 
after the final presentations?

Perfect. Book it.

No vendors, no swag, no influence. Just us 
making a decision.

Though I'm definitely ordering the expensive 
wine since it's on the company card. 😄
