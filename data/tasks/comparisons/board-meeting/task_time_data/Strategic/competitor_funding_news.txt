   - Investors: Y Combinator, SV Angel, First Round
   - Valuation: ~$32M post-money

   - Recent: Acquired supply chain analytics startup for $45M

   - Focus: M&A and international expansion
   - Our Take: They're focused on procurement, not forecasting.
     Potential partner, not competitor.

   - Valuation: $1.2B
   - Focus: Visibility platform
   - Our Take: Complementary, not competitive. Potential integration partner.


MARKET TRENDS WE'RE TRACKING
----------------------------

1. AI Hype Cycle Peak?
   Several analysts suggest AI-in-supply-chain hype may be peaking.
   Buyers becoming more sophisticated about distinguishing real AI
   from marketing. This is GOOD for us - our accuracy is real.

2. Consolidation
   SAP, Oracle acquiring smaller players. We could be a target in
   12-18 months if we hit $30M+ ARR. Board should discuss exit
   scenarios as part of strategic planning.

3. Vertical Specialization
   Winning vendors are going deep in specific verticals rather than
   horizontal. Our healthcare traction is a good proof point.

4. Post-COVID Supply Chain Awareness
   CFOs/CEOs now care about supply chain. Budget is there. The
   challenge is cutting through noise.


COMPETITOR ACTIVITY TO NOTE
---------------------------

Kinaxis:
- Launched "Kinaxis One" platform (Nov 2025)
- Aggressive pricing in 3 of our recent deals
- Rumored to be spreading FUD about our funding status
- ACTION: We need proactive PR around Series B

SAP:
- Announced "SAP AI Supply Chain" add-on
- Pricing: $200K+ minimum
- Reality: It's rebranded existing features, not native AI
- Our response: Speed-to-value messaging

Oracle:
- Quiet in our space
- Focus on ERP consolidation plays
- Lost GlobalMfg to them (existing Oracle customer)


WHAT THIS MEANS FOR SERIES B
----------------------------

1. Market validation is strong - multiple players raising/investing
2. We're differentiated on mid-market focus and AI-native approach
3. Timing is good - raise before potential market correction
4. Valuation comps support $65-80M pre-money range
