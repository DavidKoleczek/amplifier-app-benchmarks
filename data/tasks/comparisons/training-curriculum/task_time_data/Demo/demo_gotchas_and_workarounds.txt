DEMO GOTCHAS AND WORKAROUNDS
============================
Things that can embarrass you in a demo - and how to avoid them
Last Updated: January 2026 | Compiled from sales team feedback

CRITICAL: READ THIS BEFORE EVERY DEMO
=====================================

GOTCHA #1: THE "CALCULATING" VELOCITYSCORE
------------------------------------------
Problem: You open a deal and VelocityScore shows "Calculating..." instead 
of an actual score. You look unprepared.

Why it happens: Demo environment resets nightly. Scores regenerate every 
15 minutes. If you're demoing right after reset, scores may not be ready.

WORKAROUND: 
- Before the demo, open 5-6 deals you plan to show
- This "warms up" the scoring engine
- Wait 2-3 minutes before the actual demo
- Have backup deals ready in case some still show "Calculating"

TALK TRACK if it happens live:
"This score is currently updating - it recalculates as new activity comes 
in. Let me show you another deal where you can see the full breakdown."


GOTCHA #2: EMPTY ACTIVITY TIMELINES
-----------------------------------
Problem: You show a deal's activity timeline and it's empty or has only
one or two items. Doesn't demonstrate value.

Why it happens: Demo accounts don't have real email/calendar sync.
Activity is simulated and may be sparse on some deals.

WORKAROUND:
- Before demo, check the "Acme Corp - Enterprise" deal - it ALWAYS has
  rich activity data (we maintain it specifically for demos)
- Alternative: "TechStart Series B" also has good activity
- Add a quick note or task before demo to show "recent" activity

TALK TRACK if it happens live:
"This particular deal has less captured activity - in your environment,
you'd see all your emails and meetings automatically. Let me show you
a more active deal so you can see what that looks like."


GOTCHA #3: FORECAST NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP
----------------------------------------
Problem: Customer asks "why doesn't commit + best case + pipeline = total?"
You don't have a good answer.

Why it happens: These are overlapping categories, not exclusive buckets.
Commit is >90% probability, Best Case is >60%, Pipeline is all open deals.
A deal can be in multiple categories.

WORKAROUND:
- Preemptively explain this when showing forecasting
- "These are confidence-based views, not exclusive buckets"

TALK TRACK:
"Great question - these aren't mutually exclusive categories. Commit is
deals over 90% probability, Best Case is over 60%. A strong deal will 
appear in both. Think of it as layers of confidence, not separate buckets."


GOTCHA #4: THE SLOW DASHBOARD LOAD
----------------------------------
Problem: Dashboard takes 5+ seconds to load. Awkward silence while you
wait. Customer thinks product is slow.

Why it happens: Demo environment is shared, sometimes under load.
First load of the day is always slower.

WORKAROUND:
- Load the dashboard BEFORE the call starts
- Keep it in a background tab
- When you're ready to show it, it's already loaded
- Use a wired internet connection, not WiFi

TALK TRACK if it happens live:
"Let me give this a moment to load all the data - in your production
environment, this is much snappier because you'll have a dedicated
instance. Demo environments are shared."


GOTCHA #5: WRONG CURRENCY/DATE FORMAT
-------------------------------------
Problem: Customer is in Europe, demo shows dollars and MM/DD/YYYY dates.
Looks generic/US-centric.

Why it happens: Demo defaults to US settings.

WORKAROUND:
- If demoing to international customer, adjust settings beforehand
- Settings > Regional > Currency and Date Format
- Takes 30 seconds, makes you look thoughtful
- Or use the appropriate regional demo environment

TALK TRACK if you forgot:
"I notice this is showing US currency - VelocityRM fully supports
localization. Let me show you how easy it is to switch." [Then switch it]


GOTCHA #6: THE "WHY IS THIS DEAL RED?" QUESTION
-----------------------------------------------
Problem: Customer asks why a specific deal is marked "at risk" (red).
You don't know because you didn't review the demo data.

Why it happens: Demo data has specific risk reasons coded in. If you
don't know the story, you can't explain it convincingly.

WORKAROUND:
- Before demo, review the 3-4 deals you plan to show
- Know WHY they're scored the way they are
- Green deals: "Summit Healthcare" - high engagement, recent activity
- Red deals: "Omega Manufacturing" - stalled, no activity in 3 weeks

TALK TRACK if caught off-guard:
"Let me click in and see what's driving that risk score... [click into
score breakdown] Ah, here we go - you can see the momentum score dropped
because there's been no activity in two weeks. This is exactly what we
want managers to see."


GOTCHA #7: THE API ERROR MESSAGE
--------------------------------
Problem: You're showing integrations and an API error pops up. Looks bad.

Why it happens: Demo integrations aren't connected to real systems.
Sometimes they throw errors.

WORKAROUND:
- Avoid actually triggering integrations in demo
- Show the configuration screen, not the "test connection" button
- If showing Salesforce sync, show the mapping screen, not live sync

TALK TRACK if error appears:
"That's a demo environment artifact - we don't have a real Salesforce
connected here. In your environment, you'd see the actual sync status.
Let me show you what that looks like in a screenshot..."


GOTCHA #8: DEAL AMOUNTS LOOK UNREALISTIC
----------------------------------------
Problem: Demo has deals like "$847,293" or "$12,500,000" that don't match
customer's typical deal sizes. Feels irrelevant.

Why it happens: Demo data is one-size-fits-all.

WORKAROUND:
- Before demo, mentally note customer's typical deal size (from discovery)
- Focus on deals in demo that are similar size
- Or: "If your typical deal is $50K, imagine these numbers scaled down"

TALK TRACK:
"I know your deals are typically in the $X range. The principles here 
are the same regardless of deal size - the scoring, forecasting, and 
visibility all work identically."


GOTCHA #9: THE NOTIFICATION POPUP
---------------------------------
Problem: While sharing screen, you get a Slack notification, email popup,
or calendar reminder. Distracting at best, embarrassing at worst.

Why it happens: You didn't turn on Do Not Disturb.

WORKAROUND:
- ALWAYS enable Do Not Disturb before screensharing
- Mac: Control Center > Focus > Do Not Disturb
- Windows: Settings > System > Focus Assist > Alarms Only
- Or: Use a separate "demo" browser profile with no logged-in accounts

THERE IS NO TALK TRACK. Just prevent this. Always.


GOTCHA #10: MOBILE APP DEMO ISSUES
----------------------------------
Problem: Customer asks to see mobile app. You try to show it and it's
logged out, needs updating, or looks different than expected.

Why it happens: Mobile app versions change, demo creds expire, etc.

WORKAROUND:
- Only demo mobile if specifically requested
- Have screenshots ready as backup
- Test mobile app morning of demo if you plan to show it
- Consider using a screen mirroring tool so they see your actual phone

TALK TRACK if mobile fails:
"Mobile is updating at the moment - let me show you the mobile experience
via these screenshots while that completes. [Show screenshots] This is
exactly what your reps will see in the field."


BONUS: QUESTIONS THAT STUMP NEW REPS
====================================

Q: "Can we do [very specific thing]?"
A: "That's a great question. Rather than guess, let me confirm with our
product team and get back to you today. What would that capability
mean for your workflow?"

Q: "What's your uptime / SLA?"
A: "We guarantee 99.9% uptime in our SLA. I can send you the full SLA
document after this call."

Q: "Who are your biggest customers?"
A: "We have 500+ customers including [2-3 public references for their
industry]. I'd be happy to connect you with a reference customer."

Q: "Why should we trust a startup with our data?"
A: "Valid concern. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, backed by [investors],
and have 98% customer retention. We can also provide our security
documentation and connect you with our CISO if helpful."
