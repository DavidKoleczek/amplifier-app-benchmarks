Subject: Congratulations Mike Thompson - Promotion to Senior Sales Rep!

Team,

I'm excited to announce that Michael Thompson has been promoted to Senior Sales Representative, effective January 1, 2026!

Mike joined TechCorp in August 2020 and has consistently exceeded his sales targets while building strong relationships with our enterprise clients. In 2025 alone, he:

- Achieved 142% of his annual quota
- Closed our largest deal to date with Meridian Corp ($280K ARR)
- Mentored two new sales reps through their ramp-up period
- Maintained a customer retention rate of 97%

Mike exemplifies what it means to be a top performer while also being a great teammate. His promotion to Senior Sales Rep is well-deserved recognition of his hard work and dedication.

Please join me in congratulating Mike on this achievement!

Mike, we're lucky to have you on the team. Here's to continued success!

Rachel
